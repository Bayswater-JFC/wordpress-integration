  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    This was a great day for local footy to kick off the season proper. A cold wet day with club colours on display, families and supporters cheering on the
    different teams on the day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pre-game, we raised some concerns about the state of the ground with the area around the centre square in particularly bad shape. It was decided that this
    area would be cordoned off and declared out of bounds. This was noted with the officials and reported to the league.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kyra and Leah made their debut for us and were given a baptism of fire. These girls have quickly been accepted by the group and have assimilated into the
    team. It is great to see our girls welcome and accept new players like they have.
  </p>
  <p>
    Out on the field, with only nine players available for this round, (due to illness, injury and previous commitments as it was still school holidays,)
    playing against a strong and full side, we were up against it. The players that were able to attend accepted the situation we were faced with and were not
    intimidated at all by the enormous task before us. I am very proud of the fighting spirit this team showed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lexi, in ruck up against wave after wave of talls coming at her at every bounce did incredibly well and her efforts in the centre were commendable. Great
    leadership effort from Lexi.
  </p>
  <p>
    Raelene, Ella, Kyra and Leah, two of whom were making their debut for us did extremely well in defence again, faced with waves of attacks from Chirnside
    Park.
  </p>
  <p>
    We held our own in the one-on-one contests out in the middle, but with an opposition with a full bench and good use of their rotations, they were always
    going to be the fresher side.
  </p>
  <p>
    Raelene was singled out by Chirnside Park for her efforts in defence and awarded player of the round by them. We thank Chirnside Park for this gesture and
    their acknowledgment of our efforts. Even they were impressed by our tenacity despite the odds!
  </p>
  <p>
    This game was a real test of our mettle and the fact that the playing group has remained committed to the team is testament to their character. In only a
    few short weeks as a team, I am blown away by how much these girls have come together as a group.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was also a test for the coaching group as we begin our path in our new roles. With the help and support of those around us, we will work to bring out
    the best in the playing group this season.
  </p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    Today was another difficult day, lining up against a strong Mitcham side. With some players playing with injury and others recovering from illness, it was
    always going to be a hard task against a strong side.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first quarter was excellent! We held the reigning premiers scoreless with an energetic and gritty start. Kyra held her opponent well, a great effort.
    The team held its formation well and used the width of the ground to keep Mitcham at bay.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mitcham kicked away from us as our depth was challenged in the next two quarters. &nbsp;We lost our way a little bit as the game moved to the centre of the
    ground where Mitcham had the numbers and size, but this is something we can work on together as a team in the coming weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    We spoke to the players about the need for communication, shepherding, and using the width of the ground and lateral movement of the ball to our advantage.
    We also spoke about keeping our formation and staying on our players. We will work on some drills that will address this.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was good to have Lily back on deck and this gave Lexi a reprieve in the centre ruck contests. Mitcham had quite a few &lsquo;rucks&rsquo; and really
    pressed our ruck duo hard, but they held strong and ball ups in the centre square were hard fought all day.
  </p>
  <p>
    We laid some great tackles, had some great effective kicks, and kept the pressure on throughout a lot of the game, and we really showed that we are not too
    far off being a formidable opponent to teams like this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Raelene and Ella stayed in the backline for the duration of the match and had a hard job keeping the waves of attacks at bay, and this dynamic duo did well
    against some very strong kickers. I am very proud of both girls as they maintained a composure well beyond their years in very trying circumstances. Lesser
    players would have folded.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clara was one of the standouts today, she showed her versatility, playing well in a few different roles, as we tried different tactics to stop their run.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, our team had some great passages of play, laying some great tackles and effective disposals, and showing some great vision. Again, we are still
    coming together as a team, coaches included, and we have had two difficult games that would have tested the mettle of any team. I have every confidence that
    we can all grow together as a team and success is not far off.

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>This round was a BYE</p>
</div>
<div id="r04" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>Pre-game, both teams lined up in silence, and bowed our heads as a sign of respect to our troops who have served and continue to serve our country.</p>
  <p>
    The game itself was fitting of the occasion, with both teams playing very well, and pushing each other for the whole four quarters. It was a true
    arm-wrestle of a match.
  </p>
  <p>We matched their intensity in all aspects of the game. We kept our formation and were in most of the contests for the majority of the game.</p>
  <p>Our back line of Raelene, Ella, Leah and Kyra kept their formation well and kept the opposition&rsquo;s scoring to a minimum.</p>
  <p>
    Up front Fenix and Clara were instrumental in getting the ball from the centre to Jess deep in attack and we showed that we can score goals and move the
    ball forward. We scored more in the first quarter of this game than the two previous matches combined.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our centre trio of Lexie, Lily, and Gemma held the middle well, with support out wide by Shayla, Pippa, Gypsie and Ruby, who took the ball away from the
    centre and pushed forward.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lexie took a nasty knock and had to come off for a spell. Ava, who had been chomping at the bit to get involved, got her chance. Despite advising her to
    stay away from direct contests, she quickly found herself in the thick of it. Ella also took a knock to the ankle and came off for a spell to reset.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the inability to rest and rotate players, and still being a reasonably new outfit, we lost our formation as fatigue set in and gave away a few
    uncontested possessions at crucial times.
  </p>
  <p>
    All in all, we showed that we are a team that has a lot to offer and have the arsenal to be competitive this season. We can score goals, defend well, and
    get the ball out of the centre.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am very proud of the effort the girls have put in and feel confident that we can only improve from here. We will continue to work on our skills, match
    tactics and getting to know each other. Most importantly we will work on enjoying our footy and being part of a team.
  </p>
</div>
<div id="r05" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 5</h3>
  <p>
    We went into the match down to 13 players just prior to the game, and without the Head Coach due to illness. Heathmont offered to loan us a player so we
    were able to take to the field. What our team lacks in player numbers, they continually more than make up for in effort and determination.
  </p>
  <p>
    This week we also acknowledge not only the amazing players but also the parents and volunteers. From stepping into duties last minute, helping with mental
    health, and offering valuable coaching advice. We would not be able to make it out onto the field without this wonderful support. Thank you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall the scoreboard did not reflect the effort, with Heathmont finishing 25 points clear. The work rate that our girls put in was once again phenomenal,
    with increased effort and contests from Shayla finding another gear in the middle and displaying her rapidly evolving skills getting into contests, to Leah
    and Fenix seemingly covering everywhere on the ground including Leah in the ruck, Lexie offering up the crushing tackles, even with a banged up finger and
    Ruby quit literally giving every breath she had. Our midfield executed their plan really well incorporating some strategies we worked on at training, while
    we made some rotations through the midfield in an effort to save some energy to last out the game. Just prior to half time we lost Lily to injury finding
    ourselves down another player. &nbsp;Jess extended her lead as our leading goal scorer. The girls could easily have given in, but everyone of them continued
    to fight until the final siren, a testament to their character.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will reflect on the challenges and review what further changes we need to bring in and continue to work towards fixing the small things to reach our full
    potential.&nbsp;
  </p>
</div>
<div id="r06" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 6</h3>
  <p>
    On a beautiful Mothers' Day morning, Raelene, who was celebrating her 50th Game, led the team out onto our home turf. Many of the players and people in the
    crowd were wearing pink to mark Breast Cancer awareness.
  </p>
  <p>
    We started the game off well, scoring the first goal in a hotly contested first few minutes. A late first quarter hiccup, and some unlucky bounces saw the
    opposition score a couple of quick goals leading into the first break.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the middle two quarters, as the intensity of the game picked up, we lost our way and gave away undisciplined free kicks. We did not mark closely when we
    should have and gave away uncontested possession in key areas at critical times.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    The final quarter saw our girls show the true grit and determination that we know they have. They went out there and played one of the best quarters of
    football they have ever played. Unfortunately, a deep bench of six or seven players, and the opposition's rotation of fresh legs was the telling factor
    again this week.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pippa and Kyra showed that they are understanding their roles and what is required of them. Pippa with her quick hands and feet around the pack and Kyra
    shutting down her opponent very effectively. &nbsp;Raelene and Leah rotated from the back line up to the centre of the park and they did an outstanding job.
    Jess showed her speed and strong kicking up front and in defence. Lexie and Gemma teamed up well in the centre again this week. Lily played with an injury
    and was limited in what she could do, but not wanting to let her teammates down, took to the field as well and we appreciate this gesture. Ava, Clara and
    Lexie, although nursing back from injuries, played well today too.
  </p>
  <p>
    Individually, the girls did extremely well and despite being up against 21 players, they held their own and we showed that we have the mettle to win games.
  </p>
  <p>Although they did not come away with the points they made their mothers, grandmothers, aunties and all the special women in their lives proud.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    We will work on picking up players, contesting marks and our hard ball gets will need to improve. We will also need to learn to reset quickly at stoppages
    and neutralise the opposition overlapping runs.&nbsp;<br />Skills we can work on. The camaraderie, and the way the girls respect and have each other's back
    cannot be established in training drills. They just have it.

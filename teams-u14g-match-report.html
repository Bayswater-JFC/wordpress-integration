  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    Today was another difficult day, lining up against a strong Mitcham side. With some players playing with injury and others recovering from illness, it was
    always going to be a hard task against a strong side.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first quarter was excellent! We held the reigning premiers scoreless with an energetic and gritty start. Kyra held her opponent well, a great effort.
    The team held its formation well and used the width of the ground to keep Mitcham at bay.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mitcham kicked away from us as our depth was challenged in the next two quarters. &nbsp;We lost our way a little bit as the game moved to the centre of the
    ground where Mitcham had the numbers and size, but this is something we can work on together as a team in the coming weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    We spoke to the players about the need for communication, shepherding, and using the width of the ground and lateral movement of the ball to our advantage.
    We also spoke about keeping our formation and staying on our players. We will work on some drills that will address this.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was good to have Lily back on deck and this gave Lexi a reprieve in the centre ruck contests. Mitcham had quite a few &lsquo;rucks&rsquo; and really
    pressed our ruck duo hard, but they held strong and ball ups in the centre square were hard fought all day.
  </p>
  <p>
    We laid some great tackles, had some great effective kicks, and kept the pressure on throughout a lot of the game, and we really showed that we are not too
    far off being a formidable opponent to teams like this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Raelene and Ella stayed in the backline for the duration of the match and had a hard job keeping the waves of attacks at bay, and this dynamic duo did well
    against some very strong kickers. I am very proud of both girls as they maintained a composure well beyond their years in very trying circumstances. Lesser
    players would have folded.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clara was one of the standouts today, she showed her versatility, playing well in a few different roles, as we tried different tactics to stop their run.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, our team had some great passages of play, laying some great tackles and effective disposals, and showing some great vision. Again, we are still
    coming together as a team, coaches included, and we have had two difficult games that would have tested the mettle of any team. I have every confidence that
    we can all grow together as a team and success is not far off.

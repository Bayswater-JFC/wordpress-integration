  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    This was a great day for local footy to kick off the season proper. A cold wet day with club colours on display, families and supporters cheering on the
    different teams on the day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pre-game, we raised some concerns about the state of the ground with the area around the centre square in particularly bad shape. It was decided that this
    area would be cordoned off and declared out of bounds. This was noted with the officials and reported to the league.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kyra and Leah made their debut for us and were given a baptism of fire. These girls have quickly been accepted by the group and have assimilated into the
    team. It is great to see our girls welcome and accept new players like they have.
  </p>
  <p>
    Out on the field, with only nine players available for this round, (due to illness, injury and previous commitments as it was still school holidays,)
    playing against a strong and full side, we were up against it. The players that were able to attend accepted the situation we were faced with and were not
    intimidated at all by the enormous task before us. I am very proud of the fighting spirit this team showed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lexi, in ruck up against wave after wave of talls coming at her at every bounce did incredibly well and her efforts in the centre were commendable. Great
    leadership effort from Lexi.
  </p>
  <p>
    Raelene, Ella, Kyra and Leah, two of whom were making their debut for us did extremely well in defence again, faced with waves of attacks from Chirnside
    Park.
  </p>
  <p>
    We held our own in the one-on-one contests out in the middle, but with an opposition with a full bench and good use of their rotations, they were always
    going to be the fresher side.
  </p>
  <p>
    Raelene was singled out by Chirnside Park for her efforts in defence and awarded player of the round by them. We thank Chirnside Park for this gesture and
    their acknowledgment of our efforts. Even they were impressed by our tenacity despite the odds!
  </p>
  <p>
    This game was a real test of our mettle and the fact that the playing group has remained committed to the team is testament to their character. In only a
    few short weeks as a team, I am blown away by how much these girls have come together as a group.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was also a test for the coaching group as we begin our path in our new roles. With the help and support of those around us, we will work to bring out
    the best in the playing group this season.
  </p>
</div>
<div id="r02" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    Today was another difficult day, lining up against a strong Mitcham side. With some players playing with injury and others recovering from illness, it was
    always going to be a hard task against a strong side.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first quarter was excellent! We held the reigning premiers scoreless with an energetic and gritty start. Kyra held her opponent well, a great effort.
    The team held its formation well and used the width of the ground to keep Mitcham at bay.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mitcham kicked away from us as our depth was challenged in the next two quarters. &nbsp;We lost our way a little bit as the game moved to the centre of the
    ground where Mitcham had the numbers and size, but this is something we can work on together as a team in the coming weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    We spoke to the players about the need for communication, shepherding, and using the width of the ground and lateral movement of the ball to our advantage.
    We also spoke about keeping our formation and staying on our players. We will work on some drills that will address this.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was good to have Lily back on deck and this gave Lexi a reprieve in the centre ruck contests. Mitcham had quite a few &lsquo;rucks&rsquo; and really
    pressed our ruck duo hard, but they held strong and ball ups in the centre square were hard fought all day.
  </p>
  <p>
    We laid some great tackles, had some great effective kicks, and kept the pressure on throughout a lot of the game, and we really showed that we are not too
    far off being a formidable opponent to teams like this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Raelene and Ella stayed in the backline for the duration of the match and had a hard job keeping the waves of attacks at bay, and this dynamic duo did well
    against some very strong kickers. I am very proud of both girls as they maintained a composure well beyond their years in very trying circumstances. Lesser
    players would have folded.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clara was one of the standouts today, she showed her versatility, playing well in a few different roles, as we tried different tactics to stop their run.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, our team had some great passages of play, laying some great tackles and effective disposals, and showing some great vision. Again, we are still
    coming together as a team, coaches included, and we have had two difficult games that would have tested the mettle of any team. I have every confidence that
    we can all grow together as a team and success is not far off.
  </p>

<div id="r03" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>This round was a BYE</p>
</div>
<div id="r04" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>Pre-game, both teams lined up in silence, and bowed our heads as a sign of respect to our troops who have served and continue to serve our country.</p>
  <p>
    The game itself was fitting of the occasion, with both teams playing very well, and pushing each other for the whole four quarters. It was a true
    arm-wrestle of a match.
  </p>
  <p>We matched their intensity in all aspects of the game. We kept our formation and were in most of the contests for the majority of the game.</p>
  <p>Our back line of Raelene, Ella, Leah and Kyra kept their formation well and kept the opposition&rsquo;s scoring to a minimum.</p>
  <p>
    Up front Fenix and Clara were instrumental in getting the ball from the centre to Jess deep in attack and we showed that we can score goals and move the
    ball forward. We scored more in the first quarter of this game than the two previous matches combined.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our centre trio of Lexie, Lily, and Gemma held the middle well, with support out wide by Shayla, Pippa, Gypsie and Ruby, who took the ball away from the
    centre and pushed forward.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lexie took a nasty knock and had to come off for a spell. Ava, who had been chomping at the bit to get involved, got her chance. Despite advising her to
    stay away from direct contests, she quickly found herself in the thick of it. Ella also took a knock to the ankle and came off for a spell to reset.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the inability to rest and rotate players, and still being a reasonably new outfit, we lost our formation as fatigue set in and gave away a few
    uncontested possessions at crucial times.
  </p>
  <p>
    All in all, we showed that we are a team that has a lot to offer and have the arsenal to be competitive this season. We can score goals, defend well, and
    get the ball out of the centre.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am very proud of the effort the girls have put in and feel confident that we can only improve from here. We will continue to work on our skills, match
    tactics and getting to know each other. Most importantly we will work on enjoying our footy and being part of a team.
  </p>
</div>
<div id="r05" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 5</h3>
  <p>
    We went into the match down to 13 players just prior to the game, and without the Head Coach due to illness. Heathmont offered to loan us a player so we
    were able to take to the field. What our team lacks in player numbers, they continually more than make up for in effort and determination.
  </p>
  <p>
    This week we also acknowledge not only the amazing players but also the parents and volunteers. From stepping into duties last minute, helping with mental
    health, and offering valuable coaching advice. We would not be able to make it out onto the field without this wonderful support. Thank you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall the scoreboard did not reflect the effort, with Heathmont finishing 25 points clear. The work rate that our girls put in was once again phenomenal,
    with increased effort and contests from Shayla finding another gear in the middle and displaying her rapidly evolving skills getting into contests, to Leah
    and Fenix seemingly covering everywhere on the ground including Leah in the ruck, Lexie offering up the crushing tackles, even with a banged up finger and
    Ruby quit literally giving every breath she had. Our midfield executed their plan really well incorporating some strategies we worked on at training, while
    we made some rotations through the midfield in an effort to save some energy to last out the game. Just prior to half time we lost Lily to injury finding
    ourselves down another player. &nbsp;Jess extended her lead as our leading goal scorer. The girls could easily have given in, but everyone of them continued
    to fight until the final siren, a testament to their character.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will reflect on the challenges and review what further changes we need to bring in and continue to work towards fixing the small things to reach our full
    potential.&nbsp;
  </p>
</div>
<div id="r06" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 6</h3>
  <p>
    On a beautiful Mothers' Day morning, Raelene, who was celebrating her 50th Game, led the team out onto our home turf. Many of the players and people in the
    crowd were wearing pink to mark Breast Cancer awareness.
  </p>
  <p>
    We started the game off well, scoring the first goal in a hotly contested first few minutes. A late first quarter hiccup, and some unlucky bounces saw the
    opposition score a couple of quick goals leading into the first break.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the middle two quarters, as the intensity of the game picked up, we lost our way and gave away undisciplined free kicks. We did not mark closely when we
    should have and gave away uncontested possession in key areas at critical times.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    The final quarter saw our girls show the true grit and determination that we know they have. They went out there and played one of the best quarters of
    football they have ever played. Unfortunately, a deep bench of six or seven players, and the opposition's rotation of fresh legs was the telling factor
    again this week.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pippa and Kyra showed that they are understanding their roles and what is required of them. Pippa with her quick hands and feet around the pack and Kyra
    shutting down her opponent very effectively. &nbsp;Raelene and Leah rotated from the back line up to the centre of the park and they did an outstanding job.
    Jess showed her speed and strong kicking up front and in defence. Lexie and Gemma teamed up well in the centre again this week. Lily played with an injury
    and was limited in what she could do, but not wanting to let her teammates down, took to the field as well and we appreciate this gesture. Ava, Clara and
    Lexie, although nursing back from injuries, played well today too.
  </p>
  <p>
    Individually, the girls did extremely well and despite being up against 21 players, they held their own and we showed that we have the mettle to win games.
  </p>
  <p>Although they did not come away with the points they made their mothers, grandmothers, aunties and all the special women in their lives proud.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    We will work on picking up players, contesting marks and our hard ball gets will need to improve. We will also need to learn to reset quickly at stoppages
    and neutralise the opposition overlapping runs. Skills we can work on. The camaraderie, and the way the girls respect and have each other's back cannot be
    established in training drills. They just have it.
  </p>
</div>
<div id="r07" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 7</h3>
  <p>
    In contrast to the last few games, today was a cold and rainy afternoon which saw Kyra lead the team out as captain. Pre-game we spoke about what the
    expectations were and what we needed to work on:
  </p>
  <p>&middot; Picking up your player</p>
  <p>&middot; Contest marks, not giving away easy possessions</p>
  <p>&middot; Running back from midfield to help the backline</p>
  <p>
    We recognised that we were up against a team with a similar number of players and having the same niggling injuries that we have. They also have a similar
    standing in the ladder to us. This was going to be an evenly contested game. We spoke about how this was going to be a tough game given the conditions.
  </p>
  <p>The opening quarter saw only one point kicked, a clear indication of how much of a tough game this was going to be.</p>
  <p>
    In the second quarter, with a near-full squad, and with a bench, we were able to capitalise on being able to rotate players. We went into the long break
    with a 13-point lead.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recognised that they would throw everything at us in the third quarter. And they sure did! They started off with two quick goals and threatened to derail
    our game. Again, we were able to use our rotation and scored a timely goal that steadied the ship and stopped their push. We managed to end the quarter with
    a 7-point lead.
  </p>
  <p>
    Going into the final quarter, we knew that they would again try and throw everything at us, so we prepared by bolstering up our backline with some of our
    proven performers. Ella, Leah, and Lexie took to the backline with Kyra in her role stopping the charge up the middle. Our midfielders knew they would be
    called on to race back to assist the defenders as East Ringwood pressed forward. Shayla, Pippa and Ruby did great in running back to help the defenders.
    Gemma and Gypsy roved with determination assisting our rucks out in the middle. Clara and Jess, again rotating into different on-ball positions around the
    square, did a great job, both feeding the forward line and racing back to help the defence. Fenix and Ava again teaming up well to get us into the attack.
    This last quarter was another arm-wrestle with every possession being a hard ball get. Fortunately, we were able to score a goal and get some breathing
    room. East Ringwood, to their credit, kept coming at us, but our girls stood up to the challenge and came away with a hard-earned 13-point victory. The
    final score was not a true indication of how close these two teams matched up.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tori made her debut for the club and had an awesome first hit out. After a tentative start, she soon found herself in the thick of the action and fearlessly
    crashed through the pack to put the team into attack. Tori has made an impression with the team, and we are encouraged by her enthusiasm and enjoyment of
    the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    Matilda made her comeback, joining the line-up for the first time this season, with immediate impact. She too found herself in the action stringing some
    great passes and helping the forwards to keep the scoreboard ticking over.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lily, still nursing an injury, was not able to join in the ruck and took another hit to the shoulder taking her out of the game for a spell. With Lexie
    taking a knock to the leg, Raelene was asked to step up to the rucking role and was inspirational in her effort.
  </p>
  <p>
    Last but not least, our runner, Nick covered so much ground today, often running out to move players around only to be sent out again to make some more
    changes as soon as he got back to the bench. We acknowledge and appreciate his efforts.
  </p>
  <p>
    This squad has a never say die attitude, respect for each other and has each other&rsquo;s back. This was truly a team effort and the way the girls came
    together as a team today was memorable.
  </p>
</div>
<div id="r08" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 8</h3>
  <p>The sun was out but it was a cold day that saw Ella lead the team out to our home game.</p>
  <p>Grace Howard, recruited from our Pizza night, made her debut.</p>
  <p>
    We started off well scoring the first couple of points, unlucky not to start with goals. Unfortunately, we soon lost our way with players losing their
    position and leaving unmarked players to score easily and take the lead.
  </p>
  <p>
    We found ourselves in injury trouble with Lexie, Shayla, Gemma, Ruby and Gypsy all sustaining a knock or exacerbating an existing niggle. Lily, out of the
    game nursing that shoulder. Thankfully we had Mackenzie, Tigerlily, and Grace B on loan from the under 12&rsquo;s to help bolster our bench.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tori, in only her second game, again stood out with her tremendous efforts. Scoring her first goal and working so hard that not even her boots could handle
    the intensity!
  </p>
  <p>
    Jess and Fenix had standout games in the centre. Ella and Raelene played their roles well and again held their own in trying circumstances. Clara the quiet
    achiever did incredibly well and her subtle touches were fantastic to see.
  </p>
  <p>Lexie, again commanding the respect of all on the ground with her strong presence out in the centre.</p>
  <p>
    It was during this adjustment period that we further lost our way and found ourselves up against it to come back. On the scoreboard we had as many scoring
    shots as they did but they were more accurate than us. But that is the nature of the beast.
  </p>
  <p>
    All in all, today was a disappointing result, but it was not out on the ground that the biggest lapses occurred. This was a defeat that as coach, I will
    need to accept responsibility for. I was not clear in explaining what I wanted the team to do out in the field. And without a clearly laid out game plan,
    this is the result we would expect. I will take this knock as a learning opportunity in my coaching journey.
  </p>
  <p>This group has every quality that makes a great team, and I will continue to work on capturing and bringing this out.</p>
</div>
<div id="r09" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 9</h3>
  <p>A sunshiny MND round saw Shayla lead the squad out on our home ground.</p>
  <p>We started off with good intensity and it was just bad luck with a few bounces going the wrong way that stopped us from opening the scoring.</p>
  <p>
    Kilsyth are a polished side and their depth, and rotations soon became evident. With a limited bench we, again, were stifled in what we could do with our
    rotations.
  </p>
  <p>
    With Lily still out with her injured shoulder and a few players going down with early winter ailments, we struggled to field a full side. We thank Mackenzie
    for stepping up from the under twelves to give us a bench of one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our inexperience was exposed as Kilsyth were able to free a couple of players out the back of the pack and charged our defence time and time again. As has
    happened a few times this season, we found ourselves chasing runaway players as they closed in on our defensive lines putting our back line under tremendous
    pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
    We rotated our players as well as we could around the ground. Although we were strong in the contest, Kilsyth were better at getting on the end of the loose
    ball and moving it to their advantage.
  </p>
  <p>
    The positive takeaways were that we were able to find our positions on the field quickly and our starts have been improving each week. We have been
    competitive at the start and have not been caught flat-footed early on. This is testament to the team going on to the field with a conviction that every
    game is within reach and set out to prove it. Our last quarter, despite being outnumbered and tired, saw us play the best quarter of the game, with Lexie
    scoring a goal with a great long kick.
  </p>
  <p>
    We need to improve on our shepherding and tackle pressure, we often allowed their players to tackle our hard-ball getters and sat back while they took
    possession of the ball before we moved to shut them down. We also need to be more decisive with our possessions and need to move the ball quickly,
    especially when under pressure. We need to be in every contest. We will be working on these skills in training.
  </p>
</div>
<div id="r10" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 10</h3>
  <p>
    A cold morning saw Tori lead the team out for a 10:05 match at Heatherdale away to Heathmont. No Paul as trainer this weekend so Scott stepped into the
    role, and we thank him for his assistance today.<br />&nbsp;<br />We knew coming into this game that Heathmont were going to be a physical opponent. Last
    time we met them with an undermanned side, they exerted their physicality, and they took the win. This time, even though we were not at full strength, with
    illness and injury again taking its toll, keeping us to 16 players and no bench, we were ready to stand up as a team and show that we came here to
    play!&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Mackenzie again stepped up from the under12&rsquo;s and she proved to be a pocket rocket! Thank-you again for your efforts. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    It was a tough, tough match from the opening bounce to the final siren. They tried to exert their physicality on us, but we held strong across all positions
    on the field. Like we discussed, their intimidation of an undermanned side &nbsp;was the difference in the last game, and we knew that if we let them
    intimidate us, they would walk away with an easy win. Well, they did not walk away with an easy win.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the game wore on, Heathmont realised that we were more than standing up to them and they intensified their physical game. We did not capitulate, and they
    had to battle for every possession.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tori and Lexie, a couple of late casualties of this physical game, but these girls proved our fighting spirit. Leaving it all on the pitch. &nbsp; We played
    as a team and most of our attack and scoring was the result of a team effort. We put into play our rehearsed pressure play and they were lucky not to be
    tackled to the ground more often! Our tackling was outstanding, and our pressure was great. We still need to improve a bit on getting to the ball first, but
    this is about the only thing that let us down during the game, and certainly not the theme of our day.
  </p>
  <p>
    I could see our girls at the end of the day looking tired but overall satisfied in the knowledge that they have the fortitude as a team to stand up to the
    physical and mental game. They did not give in. Right to the final siren, they fought, stood up to and hustled the opposition all over the ground. A couple
    unlucky bounces and umpiring decisions went against us, but that is the nature of the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    An unlucky one-point loss to a team that was probably thinking of a walkover victory is something that the girls can be proud of. The girls showed that they
    are not a team to be taken lightly. Heathmont found that out today.

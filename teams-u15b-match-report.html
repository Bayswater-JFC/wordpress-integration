  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    The first round saw us take on North Ringwood at their home ground. The lead up to this game was really exciting, with a couple senior players taking
    training on our final hit out on Wednesday before presenting the players with their jumpers. As game day arrived, we got to the ground feeling optimistic as
    to what we could achieve. After a slowish start by our boys, the opposition controlled the game early and took a healthy lead going into half time. After
    identifying where we needed to improve, we came out and flicked a switch kicking four goals to one in the second half to go down by five goals. Although we
    lost on the day, as a team we will take a lot of positives moving forward. In particular, we got to see a handful of new players wearing the Bayswater
    jumper, all who had an excellent first game for the club. Keep coming to training and working hard as a team, and I am positive a win will only be around
    the corner.

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    With the excitement of Izaac's 50th game and playing on our home ground for the first time this season, &nbsp;I thought the team had a red hot chance to
    have a win against an opponent that won by over 100 points the week prior. We started off by kicking the first three goals in the first 10 minutes, which
    gave the team and supporters so much excitement and joy. With Blackburn kicking back we went into the first break with the scores at about even. During the
    second quarter, Blackburn got their hands on the ball a little more than we did, and kicked away to be up by 7 points at the main break.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    At half time the team was full of confidence and was excited to continue to work hard for each other in the final half. I thought that with the extra
    players we had, that if we ran hard we would eventually run over them. Unfortunately we wasted too many opportunities at goal in the third quarter kicking 1
    goal 6 behinds to Blackburns 2 goals 2 behinds. After controlling most of the 3rd quarter without having much luck in front of goal, we went into the final
    break being 9 points down. In the last quarter we continued to work really hard for each other as we did all the whole game, however, Blackburn had the
    answers to win by one goal.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>I have so much faith in this team and believe if we continue to work hard at training we can beat anyone.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    The first round saw us take on North Ringwood at their home ground. The lead up to this game was really exciting, with a couple senior players taking
    training on our final hit out on Wednesday before presenting the players with their jumpers. As game day arrived, we got to the ground feeling optimistic as
    to what we could achieve. After a slowish start by our boys, the opposition controlled the game early and took a healthy lead going into half time. After
    identifying where we needed to improve, we came out and flicked a switch kicking four goals to one in the second half to go down by five goals. Although we
    lost on the day, as a team we will take a lot of positives moving forward. In particular, we got to see a handful of new players wearing the Bayswater
    jumper, all who had an excellent first game for the club. Keep coming to training and working hard as a team, and I am positive a win will only be around
    the corner.

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    With the excitement of Izaac's 50th game and playing on our home ground for the first time this season, &nbsp;I thought the team had a red hot chance to
    have a win against an opponent that won by over 100 points the week prior. We started off by kicking the first three goals in the first 10 minutes, which
    gave the team and supporters so much excitement and joy. With Blackburn kicking back we went into the first break with the scores at about even. During the
    second quarter, Blackburn got their hands on the ball a little more than we did, and kicked away to be up by 7 points at the main break.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    At half time the team was full of confidence and was excited to continue to work hard for each other in the final half. I thought that with the extra
    players we had, that if we ran hard we would eventually run over them. Unfortunately we wasted too many opportunities at goal in the third quarter kicking 1
    goal 6 behinds to Blackburns 2 goals 2 behinds. After controlling most of the 3rd quarter without having much luck in front of goal, we went into the final
    break being 9 points down. In the last quarter we continued to work really hard for each other as we did all the whole game, however, Blackburn had the
    answers to win by one goal.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>I have so much faith in this team and believe if we continue to work hard at training we can beat anyone.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div id="r03" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    We came into this game full of confidence after going down by a kick last week. Prior to running out, we were able to reflect on Ryan who played his 50th
    game for the club.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Come the first bounce, we were up and about, kicking away to up by a small margin at quarter time. During the second quarter we had the momentum however
    couldn't kick away. The third quarter saw Lysterfield starting to take control of the game, running hard on the big ground. Whilst in the last quarter we
    kicked a couple goals and got within a goal, unfortunately with 5 and &frac12; minutes to go, Tommy went down with what looked like to be a serious injury,
    which ran the clock down. After he was able to get off the ground, we only had a minute to kick a goal to level the scores, but we were unable to do
    so.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    For the second week in a row, we came off the wrong side of the scoreboard to again go down by a goal. As a team, we are seeing some improvement each week
    which is really exciting. I often forget that although we are Under 15s, half the team is Under 14s. As I always say, if we keep coming to training and put
    in the hard yards, a win is just around the corner.

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>
    Round 4, being the last of the grading games saw us take on Wantirna South at Templeton Reserve. Being that it was the Anzac round, prior to the game we
    discussed how significant it was to recognize those who have fallen before us and what mateship really means. After the Last Post and the Australian
    National Anthem was played, the game got underway.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    After we lost the toss, Wantirna South who kicked with the wind behind them, got off to a really fast start, kicking 5 goals to 1 by quarter time. The
    second quarter saw us dig in deep, moving the ball well and playing excellent team football. By the main break we were able to reduce the margin to be
    within two goals. At half time we made some tactical moves to try and stop Wantirna South from scoring as easy as they did in the first quarter. During the
    third quarter the boys continued to play smart football, and with a relatively even quarter, restricted the opposition to scoring two goals. With the wind
    behind us in the last quarter and plenty of fresh legs, the boys were ready to do whatever it took to get a win. After kicking a goal in the first 5
    minutes, the Bayswater supporters were up and about, cheering loud from the side lines. Unfortunately after giving all we could, we again fell short by a
    kick for the third week in a row.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Although we didn't get the win, we again got to see some great games by many of the players, including Owen and Zakiya, who in my opinion played their best
    games for the club. A special mention also must go out to Harry who had a stand out game, kicking 5 goals and winning the Anzac Day medal for Bayswater.

  <h3>Round 5</h3>
  <p>
    After missing out in the past few games by a goal or so, we were determined to get off to a fast start. Unfortunately it was North Ringwood that kicked away
    early, to get up by a couple goals at the first break. During the second quarter the boys were hungry to claw their way back into the game. After lots of
    good teamwork we managed to go into the half time break with our heads held high and be within a couple goals. During the third quarter, unfortunately North
    Ringwood got the better of us to kick away to a healthy lead going into the final break. After being disappointed with the third quarter, the boys dug in
    deep. We managed to kick a goal while limiting North Ringwood's scoring. Whilst the scoreboard showed North Ringwood winning by a healthy margin, it was
    only the third quarter that really let us down.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Keep working hard boys, a win is only around the corner.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div id="r06" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 6</h3>
  <p>
    After a tough week on the training track for the team, I went into the game feeling that we had a really good chance V Norwood. The sun was shining, the
    ground looked fantastic, it was Mother's Day, everything just felt right. After last week's slowish start against North Ringwood, we again focused on
    kicking early goals. During the first quarter we were able to kick four goals, to go into the first break feeling satisfied with our efforts. During the
    second quarter the boys lifted again, getting out of second gear to kick five goals. During the half time break, we had a chat about taking the game out of
    Norwood's hands early in the third quarter. To Norwood's credit, they got the jump on us to kick four goals to our one in the third. In the last quarter it
    was goal for goal, but thankfully after a lot of recent heartache, where the close results didn't go our way, we finally got to taste success to win by 19
    points.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Well done on getting the win boys, very well deserved.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div id="r07" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 7</h3>
  <p>
    After a singing happy birthday to our Junior Club President Beccy, the boys were up and about and ready to get a second win on the trot. After a tough first
    quarter where both teams battled in the wet conditions, it was Lysterfield who went into the first break to be leading by four points. In the second
    quarter, I thought we controlled the game and used our bigger bodies to out muscle Lysterfield. We went in with a game plan to move the ball forward at all
    costs quickly. I thought that we were getting tackled too much because we weren't executing the plan as we discussed prior to the game starting. We went
    into the major break, up by three points.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    During the half time break I suggested to the boys if we tidy a couple small things up that we will run away with the game. This included playing closer to
    our man and getting rid of the ball as quickly as possible. During the third quarter, the boys responded really well by kicking three goals and keeping
    Lysterfield scoreless. In the final the boys continued to run hard and work really well for each other. Despite the very average conditions, we linked up
    well and ran out the game to win by 26 points.

  <h3>Round 8</h3>
  <p>
    Coming into Round 8 against Blackburn, we discussed the oppositions strengths and weaknesses, including #9 for Blackburn, Joel Ramage who had kicked 37
    season goals. Axel was tasked with minimising his impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through the first quarter the competition was very even, however we gave away two easy goals. The second quarter was much more challenging, facing the #1
    side&rsquo;s forward pressure. We kicked 0.1 to their 4.9.
  </p>
  <p>
    The third quarter displayed our determination through adversity, the team wanted to raise the standard and really lifted the pressure. We had 2 goals 3, to
    their 3 goals 2. Through the last term we held the bar high. We showed Blackburn our true capability, kicking five goals one behind. Although the damage of
    the second quarter was already done, the boys kept their pursuit, having an honourable last half!&nbsp;

  <h3>Round 9</h3>
  <p>
    After playing North Ringwood during the season twice already, the boys knew what we had to do to get a win. Unfortunately, we had five of our more
    experienced players out due to injury, sickness and holidays. We got off to a slow start with North Ringwood taking control early. This trend unfortunately
    continued throughout the remainder of the game. Our tackles didn&rsquo;t stick and our endeavour to win contests wasn&rsquo;t there today. Whilst we had a
    tough day at the office, we have a lot of positives to take into our next handful of games. With players coming back after the break, I feel we have such a
    good opportunity as we head into the finals. Let&rsquo;s get to training, work hard for each other and enjoy the next few weeks.

  <p>Better players- Axel, Bruce, Shev and Christian.</p>

  <h3>Round 10</h3>
  <p>
    We came into the game feeling really upbeat and ready to play a really good game for Gus in his 50th game. We started off by kicking the first 3 goals in a
    matter of minutes, and were playing really exciting football. After kicking away early, and to Norwood's credit, they kicked the next 6 goals to be leading
    by a few goals half way through the second quarter. It was at this time we started to get our hands on the ball and controlled the game, to go into half
    time leading by 7 points. After resetting the board and making a few moves, I thought that with the lack of players Norwood had, that we would run all over
    them in the premiership quarter. And that we did, kicking 5 goals to Norwood's none in the third quarter. This set us up and provided us with a handy lead
    as we went into the final term. The final term started off in a similar way as we started off the third, with us kicking the first two goals. At this time
    we gave some opportunities to players to have a run in different positions which was really exciting. The next couple games could set us up as we enter the
    final games of the season. I really believe in this team, and as long as we keep training hard and being positive we could go a long way.

  <h3>Round 11</h3>
  <p>
    After a good week on the training track, we were really expecting a good game by the boys today. We got our hands on the ball early however our voice and
    skills were slightly down. As such, Wantirna South kicked away to kick the first five goals of the game, going in with a healthy lead at the first break.
    During the second quarter, we started to work really well as a team, linking up and using our voices a lot more which allowed us to kick our way back into
    the game. At the half time break we were down by 22 points. During the last two quarters we dominated possession and general play. Like the second quarter,
    we ran all over Wantirna South and were able to run away with a 17-point win. Really pleasing part of the game today &nbsp;was although we were down by a
    big margin at the first break, we didn't give up. We worked really hard on fixing our early mistakes. Great team effort. One more game against Lysterfield
    next week before we have a week off to catch our breath before the last two games of the season.&nbsp;

  <h3>Round 12</h3>
  <p>
    This week the team was able to train prior to the Bayswater Seniors, and enjoy some time together, with the Senior club putting on some food and drinks
    after training. After an enjoyable Thursday evening, we ventured out to take on Lysterfield in one of the biggest games of the season for us. With plenty of
    rain and sunshine, the team got off to a fantastic start kicking the first goal of the game. As the first quarter rolled on I felt that we maintained
    control of the game but were unlucky not to be a few goals ahead at the quarter time break. During the second quarter, we dominated possession but like last
    week, kicked to many points and not enough goals. At half time we got together and discussed where we needed to improve to take the game off Lysterfield. In
    the third term we kicked away for a healthy lead and didn't let Lysterfield score a goal which was really pleasing. With some great passing and passages of
    play, we marched on with the game to take out a 42 point win. Over the past three weeks, the boys have been playing some awesome football and have deserved
    the three consecutive wins. I am really excited to see what we can do as we head into the last couple games of the season. Enjoy the week off and see you
    all for a home game against Wantirna South.

  <h3>Round 13</h3>
  <p>
    After a week off and three wins in a row, we got to the ground feeling ready to take on Wantirna South. After some rain during the morning, the ground was
    extremely wet. We knew that it was going to be a slog and a low scoring game. As the first quarter got under way Wantirna South who won the toss, got the
    jump on us and kicked the first goal within minutes. As the quarter rolled on, we worked really hard to kick two goals to Wantirna South&rsquo;s three by
    quarter time. During the second quarter it was a really even battle with both teams continuing to work hard for their team mates. We went into the main
    break being one point down. &nbsp;At half time we changed things up and strengthened our backline to reduce Wantirna South's scoring while they kicked into
    the scoring end of the ground. This worked well and due to the pressure we put on them they kicked one goal for the quarter to our one goal. With only four
    points in it at the final break, I was really confident that we would run all over them. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case, with Wantirna South kicking
    away to beat us by 12 points. Although we didn't walk away with a win on the day, I couldn't be any prouder of the boys. They worked hard all day for each
    other and really the result could have gone either way. One more game to go before we reset and get ready to take on Wantirna South in the first final in
    two weeks time.&nbsp;

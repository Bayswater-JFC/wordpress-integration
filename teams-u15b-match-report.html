  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    The first round saw us take on North Ringwood at their home ground. The lead up to this game was really exciting, with a couple senior players taking
    training on our final hit out on Wednesday before presenting the players with their jumpers. As game day arrived, we got to the ground feeling optimistic as
    to what we could achieve. After a slowish start by our boys, the opposition controlled the game early and took a healthy lead going into half time. After
    identifying where we needed to improve, we came out and flicked a switch kicking four goals to one in the second half to go down by five goals. Although we
    lost on the day, as a team we will take a lot of positives moving forward. In particular, we got to see a handful of new players wearing the Bayswater
    jumper, all who had an excellent first game for the club. Keep coming to training and working hard as a team, and I am positive a win will only be around
    the corner.

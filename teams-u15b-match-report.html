  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    The first round saw us take on North Ringwood at their home ground. The lead up to this game was really exciting, with a couple senior players taking
    training on our final hit out on Wednesday before presenting the players with their jumpers. As game day arrived, we got to the ground feeling optimistic as
    to what we could achieve. After a slowish start by our boys, the opposition controlled the game early and took a healthy lead going into half time. After
    identifying where we needed to improve, we came out and flicked a switch kicking four goals to one in the second half to go down by five goals. Although we
    lost on the day, as a team we will take a lot of positives moving forward. In particular, we got to see a handful of new players wearing the Bayswater
    jumper, all who had an excellent first game for the club. Keep coming to training and working hard as a team, and I am positive a win will only be around
    the corner.

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    With the excitement of Izaac's 50th game and playing on our home ground for the first time this season, &nbsp;I thought the team had a red hot chance to
    have a win against an opponent that won by over 100 points the week prior. We started off by kicking the first three goals in the first 10 minutes, which
    gave the team and supporters so much excitement and joy. With Blackburn kicking back we went into the first break with the scores at about even. During the
    second quarter, Blackburn got their hands on the ball a little more than we did, and kicked away to be up by 7 points at the main break.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    At half time the team was full of confidence and was excited to continue to work hard for each other in the final half. I thought that with the extra
    players we had, that if we ran hard we would eventually run over them. Unfortunately we wasted too many opportunities at goal in the third quarter kicking 1
    goal 6 behinds to Blackburns 2 goals 2 behinds. After controlling most of the 3rd quarter without having much luck in front of goal, we went into the final
    break being 9 points down. In the last quarter we continued to work really hard for each other as we did all the whole game, however, Blackburn had the
    answers to win by one goal.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>I have so much faith in this team and believe if we continue to work hard at training we can beat anyone.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    We came into this game full of confidence after going down by a kick last week. Prior to running out, we were able to reflect on Ryan who played his 50th
    game for the club.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Come the first bounce, we were up and about, kicking away to up by a small margin at quarter time. During the second quarter we had the momentum however
    couldn't kick away. The third quarter saw Lysterfield starting to take control of the game, running hard on the big ground. Whilst in the last quarter we
    kicked a couple goals and got within a goal, unfortunately with 5 and &frac12; minutes to go, Tommy went down with what looked like to be a serious injury,
    which ran the clock down. After he was able to get off the ground, we only had a minute to kick a goal to level the scores, but we were unable to do
    so.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    For the second week in a row, we came off the wrong side of the scoreboard to again go down by a goal. As a team, we are seeing some improvement each week
    which is really exciting. I often forget that although we are Under 15s, half the team is Under 14s. As I always say, if we keep coming to training and put
    in the hard yards, a win is just around the corner.

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>
    Round 4, being the last of the grading games saw us take on Wantirna South at Templeton Reserve. Being that it was the Anzac round, prior to the game we
    discussed how significant it was to recognize those who have fallen before us and what mateship really means. After the Last Post and the Australian
    National Anthem was played, the game got underway.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    After we lost the toss, Wantirna South who kicked with the wind behind them, got off to a really fast start, kicking 5 goals to 1 by quarter time. The
    second quarter saw us dig in deep, moving the ball well and playing excellent team football. By the main break we were able to reduce the margin to be
    within two goals. At half time we made some tactical moves to try and stop Wantirna South from scoring as easy as they did in the first quarter. During the
    third quarter the boys continued to play smart football, and with a relatively even quarter, restricted the opposition to scoring two goals. With the wind
    behind us in the last quarter and plenty of fresh legs, the boys were ready to do whatever it took to get a win. After kicking a goal in the first 5
    minutes, the Bayswater supporters were up and about, cheering loud from the side lines. Unfortunately after giving all we could, we again fell short by a
    kick for the third week in a row.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Although we didn't get the win, we again got to see some great games by many of the players, including Owen and Zakiya, who in my opinion played their best
    games for the club. A special mention also must go out to Harry who had a stand out game, kicking 5 goals and winning the Anzac Day medal for Bayswater.

  <h3>Round 5</h3>
  <p>
    After missing out in the past few games by a goal or so, we were determined to get off to a fast start. Unfortunately it was North Ringwood that kicked away
    early, to get up by a couple goals at the first break. During the second quarter the boys were hungry to claw their way back into the game. After lots of
    good teamwork we managed to go into the half time break with our heads held high and be within a couple goals. During the third quarter, unfortunately North
    Ringwood got the better of us to kick away to a healthy lead going into the final break. After being disappointed with the third quarter, the boys dug in
    deep. We managed to kick a goal while limiting North Ringwood's scoring. Whilst the scoreboard showed North Ringwood winning by a healthy margin, it was
    only the third quarter that really let us down.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Keep working hard boys, a win is only around the corner.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 6</h3>
  <p>
    After a tough week on the training track for the team, I went into the game feeling that we had a really good chance V Norwood. The sun was shining, the
    ground looked fantastic, it was Mother's Day, everything just felt right. After last week's slowish start against North Ringwood, we again focused on
    kicking early goals. During the first quarter we were able to kick four goals, to go into the first break feeling satisfied with our efforts. During the
    second quarter the boys lifted again, getting out of second gear to kick five goals. During the half time break, we had a chat about taking the game out of
    Norwood's hands early in the third quarter. To Norwood's credit, they got the jump on us to kick four goals to our one in the third. In the last quarter it
    was goal for goal, but thankfully after a lot of recent heartache, where the close results didn't go our way, we finally got to taste success to win by 19
    points.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Well done on getting the win boys, very well deserved.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 7</h3>
  <p>
    After a singing happy birthday to our Junior Club President Beccy, the boys were up and about and ready to get a second win on the trot. After a tough first
    quarter where both teams battled in the wet conditions, it was Lysterfield who went into the first break to be leading by four points. In the second
    quarter, I thought we controlled the game and used our bigger bodies to out muscle Lysterfield. We went in with a game plan to move the ball forward at all
    costs quickly. I thought that we were getting tackled too much because we weren't executing the plan as we discussed prior to the game starting. We went
    into the major break, up by three points.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    During the half time break I suggested to the boys if we tidy a couple small things up that we will run away with the game. This included playing closer to
    our man and getting rid of the ball as quickly as possible. During the third quarter, the boys responded really well by kicking three goals and keeping
    Lysterfield scoreless. In the final the boys continued to run hard and work really well for each other. Despite the very average conditions, we linked up
    well and ran out the game to win by 26 points.

  <p>Better players- Jordan Porter, Mason Finch, Jacob Green, Xavier Bickers, Brodie Talia and Blake Sales.</p>

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    The first round saw us take on North Ringwood at their home ground. The lead up to this game was really exciting, with a couple senior players taking
    training on our final hit out on Wednesday before presenting the players with their jumpers. As game day arrived, we got to the ground feeling optimistic as
    to what we could achieve. After a slowish start by our boys, the opposition controlled the game early and took a healthy lead going into half time. After
    identifying where we needed to improve, we came out and flicked a switch kicking four goals to one in the second half to go down by five goals. Although we
    lost on the day, as a team we will take a lot of positives moving forward. In particular, we got to see a handful of new players wearing the Bayswater
    jumper, all who had an excellent first game for the club. Keep coming to training and working hard as a team, and I am positive a win will only be around
    the corner.

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    With the excitement of Izaac's 50th game and playing on our home ground for the first time this season, &nbsp;I thought the team had a red hot chance to
    have a win against an opponent that won by over 100 points the week prior. We started off by kicking the first three goals in the first 10 minutes, which
    gave the team and supporters so much excitement and joy. With Blackburn kicking back we went into the first break with the scores at about even. During the
    second quarter, Blackburn got their hands on the ball a little more than we did, and kicked away to be up by 7 points at the main break.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    At half time the team was full of confidence and was excited to continue to work hard for each other in the final half. I thought that with the extra
    players we had, that if we ran hard we would eventually run over them. Unfortunately we wasted too many opportunities at goal in the third quarter kicking 1
    goal 6 behinds to Blackburns 2 goals 2 behinds. After controlling most of the 3rd quarter without having much luck in front of goal, we went into the final
    break being 9 points down. In the last quarter we continued to work really hard for each other as we did all the whole game, however, Blackburn had the
    answers to win by one goal.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>I have so much faith in this team and believe if we continue to work hard at training we can beat anyone.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    We came into this game full of confidence after going down by a kick last week. Prior to running out, we were able to reflect on Ryan who played his 50th
    game for the club.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Come the first bounce, we were up and about, kicking away to up by a small margin at quarter time. During the second quarter we had the momentum however
    couldn't kick away. The third quarter saw Lysterfield starting to take control of the game, running hard on the big ground. Whilst in the last quarter we
    kicked a couple goals and got within a goal, unfortunately with 5 and &frac12; minutes to go, Tommy went down with what looked like to be a serious injury,
    which ran the clock down. After he was able to get off the ground, we only had a minute to kick a goal to level the scores, but we were unable to do
    so.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    For the second week in a row, we came off the wrong side of the scoreboard to again go down by a goal. As a team, we are seeing some improvement each week
    which is really exciting. I often forget that although we are Under 15s, half the team is Under 14s. As I always say, if we keep coming to training and put
    in the hard yards, a win is just around the corner.

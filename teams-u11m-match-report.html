  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    We kicked off the season against Noble Park with a bit of drizzle and some wet weather footy. We wore black armbands to show our support to Pep and her
    family, we&rsquo;re thinking of you and looking forward to having you back at the club when you&rsquo;re ready.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our captains for the game were Ved and Hamish, and we had Angus, Mitchell and Josh O play their first official game for the club, with them all showing us
    why they are great additions to our team with some classy and courageous plays throughout the game, well done.
  </p>
  <p>
    We got off to a flying start controlling the play early, but not putting it on the scoreboard with 3 behinds before Noble Park got the first goal of the
    day. We seemed to drop off a bit after that and they controlled the game for the remainder of the quarter and slotted another goal to take an early lead.
  </p>
  <p>
    We reset after quarter time and started to wrestle the game back on our terms but struggled again to get the rewards on the scoreboard, only managing a
    point for the quarter but managing to keep Noble Park scoreless. The rest of the game was a real wet weather slog with not much scoreboard impact, Noble
    Park with another goal in the third and then when we got our first goal of the season on the board in the fourth it looked like we were lifting, however not
    to be this time with Noble Park making a quick reply.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst we didn&rsquo;t get the win this time, we showed some good signs which we will be able to build on to see us improve throughout the season, and
    I&rsquo;m confident we can get them next time.
  </p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    Congratulations Team! Our round 2 game saw us get our first win of the season in outstanding fashion. We were led brilliantly with a superb captain's
    performance by Caleb who finished with 5 goals! We welcomed back Pep and Levi F who played their first game for the season both getting their hands on the
    ball throughout the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was really pleasing to see improvements in our game from our focus at training this week, with a lot more consideration to looking into space and making
    sure we find a target rather than just bombing the ball forward into the contest. Our attack on the ball was fantastic with us getting to the contest first
    for most of the game, and when the opposition did get the ball we applied some great pressure and strong tackling (great goal saving tackle by Mitchell in
    the first ðŸ˜‰). Our backs played in front aggressively, rarely letting the ball get through, and swiftly rebounding us into attack. All around Gordon and I
    were really happy with everyone&rsquo;s effort and attitude.
  </p>
  <p>A big thanks to Luke Baker for filling in as trainer, and Shaun Jones for being our runner.</p>
  <p>Thanks to our parent helpers on the day, Archer, Ben and Levi F&rsquo;s families for helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the game.</p>
  <p>
    It was great to sing the song as a team after the win, hopefully our newbies will get to know the words pretty quick when we get a few more wins on the
    board.
  </p>
  <p>Go Baysie!</p>

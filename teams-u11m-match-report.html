  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    We kicked off the season against Noble Park with a bit of drizzle and some wet weather footy. We wore black armbands to show our support to Pep and her
    family, we&rsquo;re thinking of you and looking forward to having you back at the club when you&rsquo;re ready.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our captains for the game were Ved and Hamish, and we had Angus, Mitchell and Josh O play their first official game for the club, with them all showing us
    why they are great additions to our team with some classy and courageous plays throughout the game, well done.
  </p>
  <p>
    We got off to a flying start controlling the play early, but not putting it on the scoreboard with 3 behinds before Noble Park got the first goal of the
    day. We seemed to drop off a bit after that and they controlled the game for the remainder of the quarter and slotted another goal to take an early lead.
  </p>
  <p>
    We reset after quarter time and started to wrestle the game back on our terms but struggled again to get the rewards on the scoreboard, only managing a
    point for the quarter but managing to keep Noble Park scoreless. The rest of the game was a real wet weather slog with not much scoreboard impact, Noble
    Park with another goal in the third and then when we got our first goal of the season on the board in the fourth it looked like we were lifting, however not
    to be this time with Noble Park making a quick reply.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst we didn&rsquo;t get the win this time, we showed some good signs which we will be able to build on to see us improve throughout the season, and
    I&rsquo;m confident we can get them next time.
  </p>
  <p>
    A big thanks to Frankie for filling in for us to provide some bench depth, Dan Robb for being our runner, Julie for keeping us organised and Brooke for
    taking care of the kids, and congratulations to Gordon for your first game as Assistant Coach, thank you all for your support.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to our parent helpers on the day, the Tronsons, Van Der Speks, Blacks, Parmars and Shishanis for helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the
    game.

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    Congratulations Team! Our round 2 game saw us get our first win of the season in outstanding fashion. We were led brilliantly with a superb captain's
    performance by Caleb who finished with 5 goals! We welcomed back Pep and Levi F who played their first game for the season both getting their hands on the
    ball throughout the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was really pleasing to see improvements in our game from our focus at training this week, with a lot more consideration to looking into space and making
    sure we find a target rather than just bombing the ball forward into the contest. Our attack on the ball was fantastic with us getting to the contest first
    for most of the game, and when the opposition did get the ball we applied some great pressure and strong tackling (great goal saving tackle by Mitchell in
    the first ðŸ˜‰). Our backs played in front aggressively, rarely letting the ball get through, and swiftly rebounding us into attack. All around Gordon and I
    were really happy with everyone&rsquo;s effort and attitude.
  </p>
  <p>A big thanks to Luke Baker for filling in as trainer, and Shaun Jones for being our runner.</p>
  <p>Thanks to our parent helpers on the day, Archer, Ben and Levi F&rsquo;s families for helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the game.</p>
  <p>
    It was great to sing the song as a team after the win, hopefully our newbies will get to know the words pretty quick when we get a few more wins on the
    board.
  </p>
  <p>Go Baysie!</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    Our round 3 game had us playing away against Kilsyth, with them having a bye and a close loss to start the season we weren&rsquo;t really sure what we were
    coming up against. We were a few numbers short this week so thank you to Kilsyth for lending us a player each quarter to make sure we could field a full
    side and ensure as many kids could take the field as possible to enjoy the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our captains this week were Levi T and Brodie who led the team out well and got us off to a great start. We controlled the game and led almost the whole way
    but unfortunately were overrun in the last quarter with Kilsyth kicking 3 goals to our none. There were plenty of positives however, particularly putting
    ourselves in a great position to win the game. Gordon and I had a chance to reflect after the game and realised there was an opportunity for us to try
    things differently as coaches and we&rsquo;ll continue to learn and develop throughout the season alongside the team.
  </p>
  <p>
    But overall we are very proud of the kids, particularly the manner in which they play the game, they really are a great bunch. They should all hold their
    heads high knowing that we have been very competitive to start the season and I&rsquo;m sure as the season goes on other teams will see exactly what
    we&rsquo;re capable of.
  </p>
  <p>A big thanks to Luke Baker for filling in as trainer, and James Holdstock for being our runner.</p>
  <p>Thanks to our parent helpers on the day, Caleb, Jasper and Ved&rsquo;s families for helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the game.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;m confident we&rsquo;ll get back on track with a win this week at our home ground.</p>
  <p>Go Baysie!</p>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>
    Well done team, we had a great team game for round 4 against Beaconsfield. The team played in the spirit of the ANZACs as we saw great teamwork and hard
    work ethic throughout the game. We wore black armbands to show our support to Jacob and Dan Robb following a loss in the family and look forward to
    welcoming them back to the team when they are ready.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our captains for the game were Emmalee and Pep who led the team well for this special round. Congratulations to Caleb on being awarded the ANZAC medal by
    the Beaconsfield coach as the best and fairest player on the ground for our team.
  </p>
  <p>
    Congratulations also to Aadhi for playing her first game for the club, and what a cracking game it was too. Aadhi provided some real zip and showed a really
    strong attack on the contest to apply great pressure throughout the game, well done Aadhi.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gordon and I were really pleased with how everyone worked as a team and continued to look for a better option ahead of the play, which led to taking shots
    at goal from great positions on the field and kicking 8 goals straight for the game. We have seen the team as a whole improve so much already this season
    and what we have been working on at training is starting to show through in the way we play as a team.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to Frankie for helping out and providing some additional bench depth, and a big thanks to Shaun for filling in as runner and Beccy for filling in as
    trainer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to our parent helpers on the day, Josh B, Anmar, Pep, Aadhi and Angus&rsquo;s families for helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was great to sing the song as a team after the win, let&rsquo;s keep working on playing well as a team and as the season goes on we&rsquo;ll be a real
    threat to the competition.
  </p>
  <p>Go Baysie!</p>

  <h3>Round 5</h3>
  <p>
    Round 5 had us playing at home versus Heathmont who just dropped down from the grade above so we weren&rsquo;t sure what to expect and were anticipating a
    tough contest. It wasn&rsquo;t to be however, with us showing Heathmont what we&rsquo;re all about with a tough contested game and great control when we had
    possession to come away with a convincing win.
  </p>
  <p>
    We were led strongly by our captains for the game Josh B and Jacob, who both spent time in the ruck throughout the game and set a great example by competing
    hard in the contest. They both showed great leadership throughout, highlighted by Josh B playing a real team game and when playing forward letting a couple
    of goals go through for his teammates when he could have taken an easy chest mark in the square.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gordon and I were absolutely thrilled to see our whole team developing the skills we have been practising at training, with ball movement and finding a
    target with our kicks really starting to have an impact in the way we control the ball. We saw a real improvement in ground ball gets and quick handballs to
    keep the ball moving, some fantastic spoils by Hamish and Caleb, a mark on the last line of defence by Emmalee, and our trademark pressure around the ball
    to highlight the contested work we have been working on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gordon and I are really proud of the kids not just for their great effort and attitude on game day but by how much they are listening and absorbing what we
    are training and how we want to play as a team, well done to all the kids.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to our parent helpers on the day, Aadhi, Mitch, Josh O, Pep and Archer&rsquo;s families for helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the
    game, and a big special thanks to Sumeet for helping guide a new family with their role.
  </p>
  <p>It was great to sing the song as a team after our second win in a row, let&rsquo;s keep working as a team and keep our winning streak alive.</p>

  <h3>Round 6</h3>
  <p>
    Our round 6 game fell on a very special day, Mother&rsquo;s Day, which saw us celebrate the day with a guard of honour by the Mums and an inspiring speech
    by Caleb&rsquo;s Mum to get the team hyped up for a big game, thank you Lyndal. This round also supported Breast Cancer Network Australia with members of
    the team wearing a touch of pink and making a gold coin donation for this great cause.
  </p>
  <p>
    We were up against Upper Ferntree Gully at home and led out by Wes as captain who got us off to a flying start, kicking the first couple of goals for the
    game. There was no looking back from there finishing with a convincing win.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gordon and I were absolutely thrilled with the overall effort by the team, particularly having 8 separate goal kickers highlighting our willingness to share
    the ball around and find a player in a better position. Our control with the ball in hand, and ability to move the ball by finding an open player and
    hitting the target, continues to improve week by week and is becoming a real strength of how we play and is having a huge impact on our ability to score
    well, and in particular capitalise on our opportunities by kicking goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our pressure around the ball and contested play continues to be a real strength for us and it&rsquo;s great to see improvements in the areas we have been
    working on like shepherding and blocking for a teammate, attacking the contest in the air, with some more great spoils this week, and quick handballs to get
    the ball to a teammate in space.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to our parent helpers on the day, Angus, Levi T, Emmalee, Mitch and Josh O&rsquo;s families for helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the
    game.
  </p>
  <p>It was great to sing the song as a team again, that&rsquo;s three in a row, let&rsquo;s keep working as a team and keep our winning streak alive.</p>

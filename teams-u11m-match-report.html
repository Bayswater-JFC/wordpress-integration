  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    We kicked off the season against Noble Park with a bit of drizzle and some wet weather footy. We wore black armbands to show our support to Pep and her
    family, we&rsquo;re thinking of you and looking forward to having you back at the club when you&rsquo;re ready.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our captains for the game were Ved and Hamish, and we had Angus, Mitchell and Josh O play their first official game for the club, with them all showing us
    why they are great additions to our team with some classy and courageous plays throughout the game, well done.
  </p>
  <p>
    We got off to a flying start controlling the play early, but not putting it on the scoreboard with 3 behinds before Noble Park got the first goal of the
    day. We seemed to drop off a bit after that and they controlled the game for the remainder of the quarter and slotted another goal to take an early lead.
  </p>
  <p>
    We reset after quarter time and started to wrestle the game back on our terms but struggled again to get the rewards on the scoreboard, only managing a
    point for the quarter but managing to keep Noble Park scoreless. The rest of the game was a real wet weather slog with not much scoreboard impact, Noble
    Park with another goal in the third and then when we got our first goal of the season on the board in the fourth it looked like we were lifting, however not
    to be this time with Noble Park making a quick reply.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst we didn&rsquo;t get the win this time, we showed some good signs which we will be able to build on to see us improve throughout the season, and
    I&rsquo;m confident we can get them next time.
  </p>
  <p>
    A big thanks to Frankie for filling in for us to provide some bench depth, Dan Robb for being our runner, Julie for keeping us organised and Brooke for
    taking care of the kids, and congratulations to Gordon for your first game as Assistant Coach, thank you all for your support.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to our parent helpers on the day, the Tronsons, Van Der Speks, Blacks, Parmars and Shishanis for helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the
    game.

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    Congratulations Team! Our round 2 game saw us get our first win of the season in outstanding fashion. We were led brilliantly with a superb captain's
    performance by Caleb who finished with 5 goals! We welcomed back Pep and Levi F who played their first game for the season both getting their hands on the
    ball throughout the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was really pleasing to see improvements in our game from our focus at training this week, with a lot more consideration to looking into space and making
    sure we find a target rather than just bombing the ball forward into the contest. Our attack on the ball was fantastic with us getting to the contest first
    for most of the game, and when the opposition did get the ball we applied some great pressure and strong tackling (great goal saving tackle by Mitchell in
    the first ðŸ˜‰). Our backs played in front aggressively, rarely letting the ball get through, and swiftly rebounding us into attack. All around Gordon and I
    were really happy with everyone&rsquo;s effort and attitude.
  </p>
  <p>A big thanks to Luke Baker for filling in as trainer, and Shaun Jones for being our runner.</p>
  <p>Thanks to our parent helpers on the day, Archer, Ben and Levi F&rsquo;s families for helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the game.</p>
  <p>
    It was great to sing the song as a team after the win, hopefully our newbies will get to know the words pretty quick when we get a few more wins on the
    board.

  <p>Go Baysie!</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    Our round 3 game had us playing away against Kilsyth, with them having a bye and a close loss to start the season we weren&rsquo;t really sure what we were
    coming up against. We were a few numbers short this week so thank you to Kilsyth for lending us a player each quarter to make sure we could field a full
    side and ensure as many kids could take the field as possible to enjoy the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our captains this week were Levi T and Brodie who led the team out well and got us off to a great start. We controlled the game and led almost the whole way
    but unfortunately were overrun in the last quarter with Kilsyth kicking 3 goals to our none. There were plenty of positives however, particularly putting
    ourselves in a great position to win the game. Gordon and I had a chance to reflect after the game and realised there was an opportunity for us to try
    things differently as coaches and we&rsquo;ll continue to learn and develop throughout the season alongside the team.
  </p>
  <p>
    But overall we are very proud of the kids, particularly the manner in which they play the game, they really are a great bunch. They should all hold their
    heads high knowing that we have been very competitive to start the season and I&rsquo;m sure as the season goes on other teams will see exactly what
    we&rsquo;re capable of.
  </p>
  <p>A big thanks to Luke Baker for filling in as trainer, and James Holdstock for being our runner.</p>
  <p>Thanks to our parent helpers on the day, Caleb, Jasper and Ved&rsquo;s families for helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the game.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;m confident we&rsquo;ll get back on track with a win this week at our home ground.</p>
  <p>Go Baysie!</p>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>
    Well done team, we had a great team game for round 4 against Beaconsfield. The team played in the spirit of the ANZACs as we saw great teamwork and hard
    work ethic throughout the game. We wore black armbands to show our support to Jacob and Dan Robb following a loss in the family and look forward to
    welcoming them back to the team when they are ready.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our captains for the game were Emmalee and Pep who led the team well for this special round. Congratulations to Caleb on being awarded the ANZAC medal by
    the Beaconsfield coach as the best and fairest player on the ground for our team.
  </p>
  <p>
    Congratulations also to Aadhi for playing her first game for the club, and what a cracking game it was too. Aadhi provided some real zip and showed a really
    strong attack on the contest to apply great pressure throughout the game, well done Aadhi.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gordon and I were really pleased with how everyone worked as a team and continued to look for a better option ahead of the play, which led to taking shots
    at goal from great positions on the field and kicking 8 goals straight for the game. We have seen the team as a whole improve so much already this season
    and what we have been working on at training is starting to show through in the way we play as a team.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to Frankie for helping out and providing some additional bench depth, and a big thanks to Shaun for filling in as runner and Beccy for filling in as
    trainer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to our parent helpers on the day, Josh B, Anmar, Pep, Aadhi and Angus&rsquo;s families for helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was great to sing the song as a team after the win, let&rsquo;s keep working on playing well as a team and as the season goes on we&rsquo;ll be a real
    threat to the competition.
  </p>
  <p>Go Baysie!</p>

  <h3>Round 5</h3>
  <p>
    Round 5 had us playing at home versus Heathmont who just dropped down from the grade above so we weren&rsquo;t sure what to expect and were anticipating a
    tough contest. It wasn&rsquo;t to be however, with us showing Heathmont what we&rsquo;re all about with a tough contested game and great control when we had
    possession to come away with a convincing win.
  </p>
  <p>
    We were led strongly by our captains for the game Josh B and Jacob, who both spent time in the ruck throughout the game and set a great example by competing
    hard in the contest. They both showed great leadership throughout, highlighted by Josh B playing a real team game and when playing forward letting a couple
    of goals go through for his teammates when he could have taken an easy chest mark in the square.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gordon and I were absolutely thrilled to see our whole team developing the skills we have been practising at training, with ball movement and finding a
    target with our kicks really starting to have an impact in the way we control the ball. We saw a real improvement in ground ball gets and quick handballs to
    keep the ball moving, some fantastic spoils by Hamish and Caleb, a mark on the last line of defence by Emmalee, and our trademark pressure around the ball
    to highlight the contested work we have been working on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gordon and I are really proud of the kids not just for their great effort and attitude on game day but by how much they are listening and absorbing what we
    are training and how we want to play as a team, well done to all the kids.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to our parent helpers on the day, Aadhi, Mitch, Josh O, Pep and Archer&rsquo;s families for helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the
    game, and a big special thanks to Sumeet for helping guide a new family with their role.
  </p>
  <p>It was great to sing the song as a team after our second win in a row, let&rsquo;s keep working as a team and keep our winning streak alive.</p>

<div id="r06" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 6</h3>
  <p>
    Our round 6 game fell on a very special day, Mother&rsquo;s Day, which saw us celebrate the day with a guard of honour by the Mums and an inspiring speech
    by Caleb&rsquo;s Mum to get the team hyped up for a big game, thank you Lyndal. This round also supported Breast Cancer Network Australia with members of
    the team wearing a touch of pink and making a gold coin donation for this great cause.
  </p>
  <p>
    We were up against Upper Ferntree Gully at home and led out by Wes as captain who got us off to a flying start, kicking the first couple of goals for the
    game. There was no looking back from there finishing with a convincing win.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gordon and I were absolutely thrilled with the overall effort by the team, particularly having 8 separate goal kickers highlighting our willingness to share
    the ball around and find a player in a better position. Our control with the ball in hand, and ability to move the ball by finding an open player and
    hitting the target, continues to improve week by week and is becoming a real strength of how we play and is having a huge impact on our ability to score
    well, and in particular capitalise on our opportunities by kicking goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our pressure around the ball and contested play continues to be a real strength for us and it&rsquo;s great to see improvements in the areas we have been
    working on like shepherding and blocking for a teammate, attacking the contest in the air, with some more great spoils this week, and quick handballs to get
    the ball to a teammate in space.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to our parent helpers on the day, Angus, Levi T, Emmalee, Mitch and Josh O&rsquo;s families for helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the
    game.

  <h3>Round 7</h3>
  <p>Woohoo! 4 in a row!</p>
  <p>
    We&rsquo;ve really started to control games and play how we want to play. This was particularly evident in our round 7 game against Beaconsfield. Led out by
    Anmar as captain, we played them for the second time this season, we knew they were a tough opponent and on a pretty wet day, with drizzle throughout the
    game, there was a risk the weather could even the teams out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not to be however, with us coming away with another convincing win. Gordon and I were absolutely thrilled in the manner in which our kids played the game.
    Whilst being challenged by our opposition, who weren&rsquo;t playing in the best spirits, we continued to play fairly and focus on our game plan and how we
    want to play. I called it out after the game but wanted to make sure I call it out again, how proud we were of the kids for maintaining their cool, not
    getting sucked in by the opposition, and also for their resilience with a lot of kids coming off with injuries, bumps and bruises throughout the game, but
    getting back out there to help their team.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite the challenging conditions, it was really pleasing to see the kids looking to find targets and taking the kicks to move the ball and maintain
    possession, like we have been working on at training.
  </p>
  <p>
    A huge thank you to our team officials who give up their time every week and to our parent helpers on the day, Dallas, Archer, Angus, Caleb, and Levi
    F&rsquo;s families for helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the game.

  <h3>Round 8</h3>
  <p>
    Our round 8 match was away against Kilsyth for the second time this season. We knew we were up for a fight after they ran over the top of us in round 3. At
    training we have been working on contesting the ball in the air as a particular focus against Kilsyth, as their ability to move the ball by kick and mark
    was what got them over the line last time.
  </p>
  <p>
    We were led out by our captain Aadhi on her birthday, and got off to a strong start with a 2 goal to none first quarter. The second quarter was a bit of an
    arm wrestle with us just winning the quarter, but same as the last time we played them they took control and had the better of us in the third with us going
    into the last quarter with only a one point lead. We seemed to have our heads down coming into the 3 quarter time break, but Gordon and I asked the team to
    go out and take the game on in the last. We were thrilled with the response with us turning the game around and kicking another 2 goals while keeping
    Kilsyth goalless to come away with a close win.
  </p>
  <p>
    A huge thank you to our team officials who give up their time every week and to our parent helpers on the day, Caleb, Jasper and Ved&rsquo;s families for
    helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was great to sing the song as a team with ice creams in hand, we&rsquo;ll continue to work on playing a team game, and at training we&rsquo;ll focus on
    working to find space, and move the ball while maintaining possession.
  </p>

  <h3>Round 9</h3>
  <p>
    Our round 9 match was against Upper Ferntree Gully for the second time in three weeks. We had an idea of what to expect in this game so took the opportunity
    to shuffle the magnets around for a different mix of players in various positions. In this game we were focused on practising our ball movement based on
    what we have been working on at training as a priority over the final score.
  </p>
  <p>
    We were led out by Josh O as captain and got off to a strong start with a 3 goal first quarter. We were a bit quieter through the second and third quarters
    as players were adjusting to different roles and focussing on controlling and retaining possession to move the ball. Gordon and I were absolutely thrilled
    with the teamwork displayed in this game, with the majority of our goals coming from score assists by finding a player in a better position to score. This
    really showed in the last quarter where we finished strong with 4 goals, to come away with another convincing win. What was most pleasing about this was
    that despite focussing more on trialling different matchups over the ground, and controlling the ball, we still managed to have the same amount of scoring
    shots as the first time we played them.
  </p>
  <p>
    A huge thank you to our team officials who give up their time every week and to our parent helpers on the day, Levi F, Wes, Anmar, Dallas and Levi T&rsquo;s
    families for helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the game.
  </p>
  <p>It was great to sing the song as a team, we&rsquo;ll look forward to having a break due to the bye next week. I hope everyone enjoys the long weekend.</p>

  <h3>Round 10</h3>
  <p>
    What a special occasion for our team, our first 50 game players. Congratulations to Caleb and Wes on this fantastic achievement, you have both been
    fantastic to coach over the years and a pleasure to have as part of the team. It was so exciting to see you both run through your banners and lead the team
    on to the field after we acknowledged your achievement pregame with a milestone medal presentation. A huge thank you to Shaun for being involved and sharing
    some words for the boys as part of this.
  </p>
  <p>
    We got off to a flying start with our 50 gamers kicking our first and third goal of the game to finish with a 5 goal first quarter for the team. The game
    slowed a little for the second and third quarter with scoring a bit harder to come by, but after the three quarter time break we asked the team to finish
    strong and they sure did with another 5 goal quarter to finish up with the highest score from any team this season.
  </p>
  <p>
    At training during the week we focussed on blocking and communication with our teammates and it was great to see this reflected in the way we played with
    blocking and shepherding being a real feature in this game. This will be a great addition to the way we play as we come up against some tougher opposition
    at the end of the season.
  </p>
  <p>
    There were some real key highlights in this game that stood out for Gordon and myself, Levi F&rsquo;s class to evade two opponents and snap from near the
    boundary for what surely must be considered for goal of the year. Brodie&rsquo;s workrate and effort to run past three opposition players in much better
    position and get to the ball first to hold it up on the wing until help arrived and win the contest, and Josh O getting to Ben and acknowledging his great
    defensive act which often goes unnoticed, showed some real awareness and leadership to award the little things that make a difference.
  </p>
  <p>
    A huge thank you to our team officials who give up their time every week and to our parent helpers on the day, Pep, Aadhi, and Mitch&rsquo;s families for
    helping to ensure our kids get to play and enjoy the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was great to sing the song as a team, with our 50 gamers in the middle of the circle getting a light squirt of water. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the
    chance to celebrate further milestones within the team over the remainder of the season and hope to keep the momentum going.
  </p>
  <p>Go Baysie!</p>

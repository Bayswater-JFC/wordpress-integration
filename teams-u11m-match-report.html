  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    We kicked off the season against Noble Park with a bit of drizzle and some wet weather footy. We wore black armbands to show our support to Pep and her
    family, we&rsquo;re thinking of you and looking forward to having you back at the club when you&rsquo;re ready.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our captains for the game were Ved and Hamish, and we had Angus, Mitchell and Josh O play their first official game for the club, with them all showing us
    why they are great additions to our team with some classy and courageous plays throughout the game, well done.
  </p>
  <p>
    We got off to a flying start controlling the play early, but not putting it on the scoreboard with 3 behinds before Noble Park got the first goal of the
    day. We seemed to drop off a bit after that and they controlled the game for the remainder of the quarter and slotted another goal to take an early lead.
  </p>
  <p>
    We reset after quarter time and started to wrestle the game back on our terms but struggled again to get the rewards on the scoreboard, only managing a
    point for the quarter but managing to keep Noble Park scoreless. The rest of the game was a real wet weather slog with not much scoreboard impact, Noble
    Park with another goal in the third and then when we got our first goal of the season on the board in the fourth it looked like we were lifting, however not
    to be this time with Noble Park making a quick reply.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst we didn&rsquo;t get the win this time, we showed some good signs which we will be able to build on to see us improve throughout the season, and
    I&rsquo;m confident we can get them next time.
  </p>
  <p>

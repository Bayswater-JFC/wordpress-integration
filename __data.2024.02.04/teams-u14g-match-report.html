  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    It wasn&rsquo;t a great day for the under 14 girls in round two. &nbsp;Playing against SBL away, we were outplayed for most of the game by a team that was
    competing harder at more stoppages and for longer periods in the game. &nbsp;As the match went on, it was clear that we were a younger team, missing a
    couple of top age girls to help balance the contest. &nbsp;A tough loss 8 &ndash; 71. &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst we are focusing on improving our skills at training, it is our game sense and awareness of what to do and where to be that we also need to work on.
    &nbsp;Such simple things as rushing a behind, rather than allowing the opportunity for the other team to kick a goal, or running back in defence and staying
    on our opposition player. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the little things that can make a big difference.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    A tough game played by Shaylee, intercepting many SBL forward movements. &nbsp;Lily and Grace worked hard in the ruck and Jess was lively around the
    stoppages being quick enough to break away in our forward line to kick our only goal in the third quarter. &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    A lot more footy to be taught. &nbsp;The coaching team will work hard on teaching the skills and game knowledge to give the girls the best opportunity to
    improve. &nbsp;However, the correct mindset brought to each and every training session and game is up to every individual on the team. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    Our first home game of the season in round 3, playing against Waverley Blues, who had also won one game and lost one. &nbsp;After a disappointing loss in
    round two, the girls were keen to make amends. &nbsp;Raelene was our captain today and we were looking to get off to a quick start. &nbsp;However, our
    sluggish start let us down again, as we let our opposition kick three goals in the first quarter. &nbsp;In true Anzac day spirit, we lifted and won the
    second quarter by kicking two points.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Finding some belief, we kicked two goals in the third quarter and at the last break we were down by only 3 points. &nbsp;The two goals coming from first
    time kickers Ruby and Shayla. &nbsp;After Waverley kicked there only other goal for the game in the last quarter, it would have been easy for our girls to
    drop their heads. &nbsp;Instead, they pushed harder and scored as Shaylee kicked our third goal for the game.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    As time run out, we were left five points down in a great effort on such a special day. &nbsp;More commitment to each other, playing harder, increased
    tackling and pressure were all reasons for putting up a great contest. &nbsp;Some excellent efforts from Jade, Shayla, Raelene and Grace today, with another
    outstanding game from Shaylee, being presented with the Anzac day medal for her courage and competitiveness.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Final scores: Bayswater 23 &ndash; Waverley Blues 28</p>
</div>
<div id="r04" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>
    Round 4 was again at home and we played against East Ringwood, with Shaylee our captain. &nbsp;We had three of our players out, but were helped out by Fenix
    and Tiger-Lily from the under 12&rsquo;s who played before us. &nbsp;The opposition had 18 and also gave us a player each quarter, so we played 15 verse
    15.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Our aim was to win each quarter today, and whilst we won the first and third quarters, we played a really solid full game. &nbsp;We kicked the first goal,
    which was a bonus as we have struggled to get off to a good start in recent weeks. &nbsp;In the second quarter we conceded a goal, so the scores were almost
    level at half time.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    The efforts by all girls really continued in the second half with all girls running hard. &nbsp;In the third quarter, Jade, Raelene and Clara were fantastic
    in defence, While Ruby, Ava and Gemma were pushing to as many contests as they could. &nbsp;Likewise, the selfless running from Carly all day meant we
    always had good numbers at most contests. &nbsp; Grace stepped up a level in the second half winning three free kicks in the third quarter from great
    tackles, and converting one of those free kicks into a goal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Leading by 17 points at three quarter time, East Ringwood were always going to push hard, kicking two goals early in the last quarter with still plenty of
    time remaining. &nbsp;Shaylee battled hard as captain all game to set a high standard for her team mates to follow, and wasn't going to settle for anything
    other than a win. &nbsp;The amount of forward line entries the opposition had, really set them up for a great finish. &nbsp;However, our backline held up
    with Lily and Lex leading the way, really working hard. &nbsp;We flooded their backline for the last few minutes with extra players and were able to hold on
    to a well deserved four point win. &nbsp;Final score &ndash; Bayswater 28 &ndash; East Ringwood 24. &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>*A huge thank you to Tiger Lily and Fenix for helping us out today, they both played fantastic!!</p>

<div id="r05" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 5</h3>
  <p>
    Round 5 away against South Croydon, our captains for the match Clara and Jess. &nbsp;A tough opposition, and from what we&rsquo;ve seen so far, clearly one
    of the better teams, that may have been better suited to a higher grade.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Without the right mindset and attitude, this game was always going to be a struggle. &nbsp;We started slowly and never really gained any ascendancy against
    an overall bigger, older and stronger team. &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Shaylee, Lily, Gemma, Grace and Jess had some good moments during the game, and we welcomed three new players to our team today &ndash; Molly, Brooke and
    Matilda, who faced a real baptism of fire for their first games. &nbsp;However, it&rsquo;s all a learning process, and we have much work ahead of us.
    &nbsp;Final score Bayswater 0 &ndash; South Croydon 80
  </p>

  <h3>Round 6</h3>
  <p>
    Round six for the under 14 girls was away to The Basin for the second time this season. &nbsp;Our captains for the day were Grace and Ruby. &nbsp;A tougher
    game than our first encounter, as both teams had 18 players on the ground for this mothers day clash.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    We started well, which hasn&rsquo;t been something we&rsquo;ve done most of the season. &nbsp;Kicking two goals in the first quarter, meant our opposition
    were chasing all day. &nbsp;The Basin kicked their only goal in the second quarter, however we countered in the third with a goal of our own. &nbsp;Had we
    kicked a little straighter, we may have won by more, The end result &ndash; Bayswater 3 goals 10 behinds = 28 &ndash; The Basin 6. &nbsp;Goal kickers
    &ndash; Lily, Ava and Shaylee.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Some highlights for the day was seeing Ava kicking her first goal, Clara &nbsp;running away from the pack multiple times, Lexie&rsquo;s strong tackling all
    day and second game player Matilda running hard all day to impact many contests. &nbsp;A great team performance.
  </p>
</div>
<div id="r07" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 7</h3>
  <p>
    Back at home for round seven against Knox. &nbsp;Our captains for the day were Keely and Carly. &nbsp;We welcomed another new player in Scarlett to our
    team, giving us 20 players in total. &nbsp;The opposition had 17 players, so we were able to play 16 verse 16 all game.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    We started well, kicking with the wind we scored the first goal and lead at quarter time. &nbsp;The opposition hit back in the second quarter to take a
    narrow lead at half time. &nbsp;Whilst our first quarter was good, we had far too many girls not pushing themselves to get involved in the second quarter
    and conceded a small half time lead. &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    After a &lsquo;rev-up&rsquo; at half time, the girls responded and kicked away to a 10 point lead at three quarter time. &nbsp;We knew we were going to be
    defending that lead in the last quarter and for the first 10 minutes, we held off Knox. &nbsp;Unfortunately, two late goals, one in the last minute of the
    game put them ahead and we ended the game three points down.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst footy is a game of skills, too many times throughout the game we didn&rsquo;t follow the team plan and were overtaken in the last minute to
    eventually lose. &nbsp;However, it was too many errors in general play throughout the whole game that we will learn from today. &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Final score Bayswater 28 to Knox 31. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Goals today to Ava, Shaylee and Jess.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Best players today for us included Grace, Shaylee, Lex, Keely, Jess and Carly</p>

  <h3>Round 8</h3>
  <p>
    Wet conditions greeted us for round 8 at home against SBL. &nbsp;Similar to the conditions we played in, when we played the same team earlier in the season
    and lost 8 to 71. &nbsp;Lexie was our captain and with a couple of late omissions, we had 17 players for this game.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    We were under pressure early in the game with the ball being deep in our backline. &nbsp;Showing how far we have come as a team, instead of conceding goals
    we rushed behinds to give us a chance to clear the ball from our backline. &nbsp;Great effort early by Envy, Jess and Raelene. &nbsp;We trailed by only nine
    points at half time and it was clear we were going to be a much tougher opposition today. &nbsp;Our captain Lexie, doing some great ruck work and even
    better follow up work around the ground. &nbsp;Ruby, Matilda, Envy and Scarlett nullifying contests when up against multiple opposition players. &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst we didn&rsquo;t score a goal for the game, we had some extremely close chances by Grace and Lex which would have made the scoreboard closer, however
    the contest always looked very tight. &nbsp;In trying conditions, we could have stopped, relaxed and let the other team take control. &nbsp;However, it was
    the opposite and we pushed all day and right up until the final siren, with some awesome final quarter efforts from Lily and Keely. &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    A bigger loss on the scoreboard this week compared to last week, but the coaching team couldn&rsquo;t have been more proud. &nbsp;One of the best four
    quarter efforts this season by all players, with a stand out four quarter performance from Jess. &nbsp;It was the effort contributed by everyone to see our
    final score being SBL &ndash; 20 to Bayswater &ndash; 5. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s a 15 point loss this round, compared to a 63 point loss last time we played the
    same team! &nbsp;Well done girls!!&nbsp;
  </p>

<div id="r09" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 9</h3>
  <p>
    Perfect weather for round 9, away against Chirnside park. &nbsp;We had a few last minute players unavailable for different reasons, and played the game with
    16 girls. &nbsp;We welcomed Ella back for this match and our captain was Lily.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst we kicked the first goal of the game and had a lot of forward line entries, we trailed at quarter time, 6 to 7. &nbsp;We were doing just enough and
    it seemed like we were all running at 75% of our capacity. &nbsp; A small rev up at quarter time and we didn&rsquo;t look back, quickly taking the lead and
    playing some tough footy like we had the previous two weeks.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Shaylee and Jess were doing their thing around the stoppages, Lex, Keely and Lily were having an impact all over the ground and we were getting great effort
    from our small brigade, with Molly, Gemma and Shayla running hard. &nbsp;Shayla finished a great play with a running goal.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    The coaches move the girls into different positions throughout the game, and it&rsquo;s great to see the development. &nbsp;Ava playing as a ruck rover
    today in the third quarter, Clara off half back with lots of run, Raelene on the wing after leading our backline, are all fantastic achievements from a game
    that was there to be won, only if we put in the effort and worked hard for it.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;Awesome win today girls, Bayswater 31 &ndash; Chirnside Park 17&nbsp;</p>

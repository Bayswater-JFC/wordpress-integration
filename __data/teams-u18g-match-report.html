  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>It was a sunny afternoon for the opening of the season against Glen Waverley Rovers, on the wide expanses of Brentwood Reserve. Our regular side had Charli and Kelsie out, but was bolstered by U16s Lauren, Allannah and Claudia with Ruby and Maggie joining us later. Given our low numbers, we played 15 a side. The team were in Bayswater colours, lead by Tyler and Jas F, with Paige finally celebrating her 50th milestone in her 51st game. Jo was left to coach the side solo, after Jordy and Lauren were unavailable.</p>
<p>We won the toss and kicked with the wind, but got off to the worst possible start when a long kick from a Glen Waverley player trickled slowly over the goal line in the opening minute. That initial goal was effectively the Rover's lead at half time, but after a great third quarter, we'd narrowed the margin to two points. Unfortunately the final quarter was played mostly in the Glen Waverley forward line, and the final result was the Rovers winning the game 2.11-23 to 2.4-16. Some great signs for our girls who fought to the end despite being outnumbered all day.</p>
<p>Highlights included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rana holding the backline together for large parts of the game</li>
<li>Some breathtaking runs by Katia down the middle of the ground</li>
<li>A contest where Tyler was outnumbered 3 or 4 to one, and made second, third and fourth efforts to force a stoppage</li>
<li>Some great one percenters by Em CT, including a magnificent spoil</li>
<li>A goal to Paige in her celebration game, as well as a goal to Jas P.</li>
</ul>
<p>We weren't far away today, and I'm sure the coaches will tighten some things up during the next couple weeks which will help us improve in the coming games (so get to training!).</p>
<p>Thanks to our helpers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trainer: Karren Martin</li>
<li>Runner: Adam Ternes</li>
<li>Timekeeper/Scoring: Brooke Cathro</li>
<li>Goal Umpire: Mick Sharry</li>

</ul>
<p>Bring on Round 2!</p>

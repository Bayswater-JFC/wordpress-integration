  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>It was a sunny afternoon for the opening of the season against Glen Waverley Rovers, on the wide expanses of Brentwood Reserve. Our regular side had Charli and Kelsie out, but was bolstered by U16s Lauren, Allannah and Claudia with Ruby and Maggie joining us later. Given our low numbers, we played 15 a side. The team were in Bayswater colours, lead by Tyler and Jas F, with Paige finally celebrating her 50th milestone in her 51st game. Jo was left to coach the side solo, after Jordy and Lauren were unavailable.</p>
<p>We won the toss and kicked with the wind, but got off to the worst possible start when a long kick from a Glen Waverley player trickled slowly over the goal line in the opening minute. That initial goal was effectively the Rover's lead at half time, but after a great third quarter, we'd narrowed the margin to two points. Unfortunately, the last quarter was played mostly in the Glen Waverley forward line, and the final score saw the Rovers winning the game 2.11-23 to 2.4-16. Some great signs for our girls who fought to the end despite being outnumbered all day.</p>
<p>Highlights included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rana holding the backline together for large parts of the game</li>
<li>Some breath-taking runs by Katia down the middle of the ground</li>
<li>A contest where Tyler was outnumbered 3 or 4 to one, and made second, third and fourth efforts to force a stoppage</li>
<li>Some great one percenters by Em CT, including a magnificent spoil</li>
<li>A goal to Paige in her celebration game, as well as a goal to Jas P.</li>
</ul>
<p>We weren't far away today, and I'm sure the coaches will tighten some things up during the next couple weeks which will help us improve in the coming games (so get to training!).</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>Another glorious day for ANZAC Round, we wore Knights colours in our first home game at Liberty Reserve, up against Upper Ferntree Gully. With Charli and Kelsie coming into the side we had all 15 of our team on the field, and were also again supported by U16s Lauren and Allannah, who had played in the match immediately before our one. Jo was joined in the coaching box by Jordy and Lauren.</p>
<p>Once again we started 15 a side, and quickly gained the ascendancy in the first quarter, kicking 2 goals and holding Upper Ferntree Gully goalless. The structure the coaches had been working on during training was evident, especially during the middle part of the game, with the defence and midfield often able to position themselves correctly without too much coach involvement. The match got a bit spiteful in the second half, with our opponents eventually only able to field 12 a side after some strong tackling by our girls. Our players continued to play tough, fair, consistent footy for four quarters, and ran out winning the game 7.9-51 to 0.3-3.</p>
<p>Highlights included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kelsie solid in defence for most of the game, then drifting forward for a goal in the last quarter</li>
<li>Lauren and Allannah again blending seamlessly into the team</li>
<li>Neve, working hard in defence including some great use of the body to out position her opponents</li>
<li>Libby proving a handful up forward, kicking a goal</li>
<li>Holly not only taking marks and winning the ball, but helping her teammates by chasing and shepherding, earning her the ANZAC medal</li>
</ul>
<p>The numbers that have been getting to training really helps build the team, and helps the coaches run full ground drills. Everyone benefits, so keep coming when you can!</p>

<p>Unfortunately we have a bye this weekend, but we're looking forward to seeing how the team builds into Round 4!</p>

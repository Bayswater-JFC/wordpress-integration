  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    The season started off with an exciting time for Mateo, who played his 50th game for the club. North Ringwood got off to a fast start, kicking 5 goals in
    the first quarter.
  </p>
  <p>After regrouping at the first break, we identified that our pressure wasn't at the level that it needed to be.</p>
  <p>Led by the midfield, the team lifted and as such limited North Ringwood's scoring for the remainder of the game, while we kicked a few goals ourselves.</p>
  <p>
    As was seen in Sunday's game, we have set a standard, which moving forward we need to bring week in week out. If we can continue to 'bring the heat' we will
    have an enjoyable season.

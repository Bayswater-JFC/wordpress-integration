  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    The season started off with an exciting time for Mateo, who played his 50th game for the club. North Ringwood got off to a fast start, kicking 5 goals in
    the first quarter.
  </p>
  <p>After regrouping at the first break, we identified that our pressure wasn't at the level that it needed to be.</p>
  <p>Led by the midfield, the team lifted and as such limited North Ringwood's scoring for the remainder of the game, while we kicked a few goals ourselves.</p>
  <p>
    As was seen in Sunday's game, we have set a standard, which moving forward we need to bring week in week out. If we can continue to 'bring the heat' we will
    have an enjoyable season.

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    Prior to the game, I explained to the boys that the game wasn't going to be pretty given the weather conditions. I asked them to bring effort and get their
    hands dirty. We started the game off really well with all players contributing, putting their head down and getting to work. As the game went on, we tried
    our very best but were unfortunately out played against a better outfit on the day. With players coming back, I expect us to get better, and if we continue
    to get to training and work hard a win will be around the corner. Special mentions to Xavier who run hard all day, providing us with lots of spark and
    hardness around the packs, Jordan and Zakiya in the ruck, Axel at full back and to our two new players Angus and Shevinn who looked at home on the footy
    field. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    It was a memorable occasion for the team to be a part of such a special game. Prior to the game we were able to pay our respects to the men and women that
    served and currently serve for Australia and New Zealand. At the conclusion of the last post, it was game time. Unfortunately, Lysterfield got the jump on
    us early. They were first to the ball which allowed them to play the game on their terms. &nbsp;As the game continued on, the boys didn't provide enough
    pressure to slow Lysterfield from scoring, allowing them to control the game. At three quarter time, I explained to the boys that we needed to apply more
    pressure and work harder for one another. To be teams credit, we got work and ran the game out, kicking three goals to one in the final term to earn some
    respect back. Next game Vs Vermont will be a tough game as they are each week. We need to bring the heat from the start and work harder for each other.
    Finally, a big congratulations to Tommy Walker for being awarded the Anzac Day medal for the Bayswater JFC.&nbsp;

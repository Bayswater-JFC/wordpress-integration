  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<div>Our first game of the season was against Boronia Hawks, whom we haven't played against for some time. We knew it would be a test for our boys&nbsp;but the team went in with a lot of enthusiasm and excitement.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The conditions were quite warm and due to school holidays we had a couple of players away (thankfully those families that were affected by COVID came out of isolation&nbsp;just in time for their boys to play!).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although the day did not go our way, both Troy and we were really happy with many aspects&nbsp;of the game&nbsp;today including some quality&nbsp;link ups that saw us move the ball from the backline to the&nbsp;forward line on several occasions and the tough running and efforts of many of the boys. We welcomed new players to our ranks officially today including Cooper, Connor, Harry, Jack, Nathan and Oli, who proved today just how valuable they'll be to the team. Kai was absent today but we're certainly stoked to have him on&nbsp;the team as well.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There were some fantastic individual performances today from Tom and Samuel who ran their guts out all day, Cooper's ruck work, Tyler's work on the wing and the midfield and Jack's stablising&nbsp;work in the defense. Special mentions to Oli who for a guy that never has played football before, proved to be an asset wherever we put him, Xavier who worked hard all day and was a great influence in the half forward line and Alex for stepping in to help Cooper with the ruck duties. Harry was great in the forward line snagging a couple of goals as well.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Accuracy and lack of communication at times cost us but the boys will only get better as they get to know each other better. Remember, we have 7 new&nbsp;boys to the team who have never played together before, but it will only be a short time until they really gel together. As with anything new, there's always a learning curve and this includes getting to learn each other and the way we play.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We got better as the game went on. We had 16 scoring shots and outscored the opposition in the last quarter which shows two things. When challenged, the boys can certainly lift and they don't quit as well as the ball spending a lot of time in our forward line, which once accuracy improves, there's the potential to put up some very solid scores.</div>

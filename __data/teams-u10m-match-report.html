  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<div>What a beautiful day for Round 1 as we played away against Boronia.&nbsp; During the week the team was lucky enough&nbsp;to have a training session with Malcolm Bangs focussed on tackling and how to win contested ball.&nbsp; It was very clear from the start that the lessons had been effective.&nbsp; I was really impressed with how well all of the kids went for the ball from the start.&nbsp; What I was most happy with was how fairly they did it - I don't remember seeing us give any free kicks for unfair tackles.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I thought the handballing and passing was really good today too.&nbsp; There were some really great team first moments where players would dish out a handball to a running teammate or look to pass further up the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am looking forward to a holiday, I am also a touch sad that we won't be playing next week as I am just really enjoying watching the team improve as individuals and collectively each week.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are in a great position as a team having 22 really capable players.&nbsp; Today we were in a position to help Boronia put a bigger team on the park and have a full team (we had 21 players to their 14).&nbsp; I was really happy that when I asked for volunteers each quarter to play for the opposition, I never had to tap anyone on the shoulder.&nbsp; I always had enough players to put their hand up to help.&nbsp; A big point I have raised with the kids this year is sportsmanship.&nbsp; I have put forward that above all, I want people to see this team as a group of great sportspeople.&nbsp; Seeing our players put their hands up then going out to give their all, even when in opposition colours makes me really proud.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Have a safe and enjoyable Easter Break.&nbsp; I can't wait to see everyone ready to get into round 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br aria-hidden="true" />Cheers - Tim</div>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<div>VS.&nbsp; Belgrave South</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After a week off with the easter break, the kids were keen to get straight back in for round 2 at home against Belgrave South.&nbsp; This game held particular significance with a special ANZAC ceremony before the game.&nbsp; I spoke with the kids before the game (as Rob did on&nbsp; Friday) about what the ANZAC spirit is and the importance of fair play and sportsmanship on the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We were down 4 players, but still stepped up to provide 2 players each quarter to help even numbers out.&nbsp; It was also our first game on a full sized oval.&nbsp; With all of that, the kids went out and battled hard from the start against some pretty solid opposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br aria-hidden="true" /><br aria-hidden="true" />It was a tough contest from the first bounce, but our players were always up for the challenge with some significant efforts.&nbsp; This continued throughout the game as things got tougher each quarter.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Again I was really proud of everyone's efforts in the game.&nbsp; I thought they really did play with the ANZAC spirit I asked for and gave it a red hot go.&nbsp; I am really enjoying seeing the growth in a number of players and can't wait to get stuck into round 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I don't like to single out individuals specifically in my reports, however in this case, I want to congratulate our captain for the day Tigerlily who was incredible all game, and pushed all day to win herself the ANZAC medal as awarded by the opposition coach - before quickly running off to play U12 girls.&nbsp; Well done.</div>
</div>
<div id="r03" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<div dir="auto">Vs Endeavour Hills</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Today we headed out to Endeavour Hills to play the Eagles for round 3. It was the first game this season where we could play 18 vs 18 and not loan players to the opposition, so it definitely made my job on the bench a little easier.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">I set the team the challenge this week of being first to the ball and really emphasised this in training this week as well as before the game.</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">As with anything I have asked in games this year, the group responded so well. I felt that our attack at the ball was outstanding from the first bounce.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">There were a few tough challenges thrown our way throughout the game, but I felt again our group really responded incredibly well.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">I am becoming more proud each week of how the team shows up and represents the Bayswater jumper.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Bring on Round 4!&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div id="r04" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 4</h3>
<div>vs Noble Park</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Firstly, Happy Mothers Day.&nbsp; It was a special day and our team wanted to make sure they all put on a special effort for their mums.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br aria-hidden="true" /><br aria-hidden="true" />We were playing at home to Nable Park and unfortunately with holidays and illness, we were down to 16 so for the first&nbsp;time this season, we were a little short.&nbsp; I asked for the team to really dig in and put together a big effor today with reduced numbers with a focus on being first to the ball and shepherding their teammates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From the first bounce everyone played to their fullest.&nbsp; I couldn't fault anyone's effort.&nbsp; Noble Park were a tough team too - very hard running and quite physical, but our group didn't hold back and kept pushing.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What I was most proud&nbsp;of throughout the match was how despite being challenged, our players kept going and held their heads high.&nbsp; This showed especially in the last quarter where they managed to keep the opposition goalless while adding a couple themselves.&nbsp; Where they could have been forgiven for dropping off a little through fatigue with a physical game and short numbers, they just didn't and battled hard to the final siren.&nbsp; Well done to everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div id="r05" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 5</h3>
<div>Unfortunately our opposition had to forfeit, but to ensure the kids got a run, we created a intrateam practice match.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br aria-hidden="true" />This turned out to be a lot of fun for the team by challenging themselves against teammates.&nbsp; It was also a great chance to move positions around and give everyone a really good run on the ball, in defence and up forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br aria-hidden="true" /><br aria-hidden="true" />There was really good spirit, and some great attack at the ball.&nbsp; The players took a lot out of the game which was great and have kept themselves sharp ahead of their game next week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you again this week as three additional players from our squad also stepped up to play U11's following our match and did an outstanding job.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div id="r06" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 6</h3>
<div>
<p>It was a cold frosty start to the day as we headed over to Lewis Park to take on Fairpark.&nbsp; After playing an 8vs8 match against eachother last week, it was great to get out on a full ground and play 18 vs 18 for the first time in a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>It was clear from the first contest that Fairpark were going to give us a good run and it was a really good game to watch from the beginning.&nbsp; Throughout the game, I challenged a number of players with extra midfield responsibilities - while making a point of getting everyone to have a run in each position throughout the game.&nbsp; I was really impressed with how everyone stepped up when it was their turn to take on a task.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>It has been great in recent weeks to see a few players really step up and lift in confidence each week.&nbsp; A few special efforts today included - Cooper Barbour who really stepped up in the midfield and played an important role in the first quarter.&nbsp; Tigerlily - just delivers every game and there was one moment where she found herself in a contested position with 4 against one and still managed to create a stoppage for us.&nbsp; Brendon Perry stepped up to captain the team today and stood tall as a key defender in the second half for his team. Lawson Guymer is another kid growing with confidence every week and really starting to put that powerful boot to great use.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br aria-hidden="true" /><br aria-hidden="true" />Well done to all players for their efforts.&nbsp; Bring on Round 7!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="r08" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 8</h3>
<div>Round 8 saw us at home to Boronia on what was a very cold and wet day.&nbsp; After a great training session on Friday, there were a few key things I wanted to see from the players with ball movement and holding positions on the ground.&nbsp; I took the opportunity to mix things up a bit with the line up and I was really impressed with how the kids stepped up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>All round, I thought it was one of the best team games we played all year.&nbsp; Talk was loud, and everyone looked out for eachother.&nbsp; The comradery was very much on show today.&nbsp; It was quite heart warming on a freezing cold day to see the kids looking out for eachother.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Special mentions to some great efforts today.&nbsp; Zane who kicked his first goal and played his best game of the year with a fantastic attack everytime he went near the ball.&nbsp; Jackson Portbury who played well everywhere he went today and again I thought played his best game this year setting up a goal and nearly kicking a couple himself.&nbsp; Zach has grown a lot this season with his attack on the ball, and he collected a stack of important touches today to match the attack. Luca was another player who had his best game of the year getting a few good touches and playing an important role in the ruck in the last quarter.&nbsp; Sid played a brilliant game too, but for me the way he went about trying to get everyone involved today was what was most impressive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Keep up the great work everyone, and enjoy the long weekend.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div id="r09" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 9</h3>
<div>Vs Rowville</div>
<div>Round 9 was MND round and it was great to see the whole team wearing blue socks to support a really worthy cause.&nbsp; We headed out to Rowville in Rowville.&nbsp; Rowville had a pretty stocked bench with 24 players while we ran a smaller bench, so the team was going to need to really dig deep.&nbsp; After a bit of a slow start, the second quarter was outstanding as we managed to kick a few goals.&nbsp; The second half the players really did try hard and kept pushing against a really solid opposition.&nbsp; Plenty to take out of this game ahead of a massive game next week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div id="r10" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 10</h3>
<div>Vs Noble Park</div>
<div>Round 10 saw us return home against Noble Park who gave us a really tough game earlier in the year.&nbsp; I spoke with the team before the match about the importance of playing a role for the team and in particular running together in numbers.&nbsp; The whole group came out firing from the first bounce and were outstanding in their efforts to not only get first to the ball, but also go back for second and third efforts were needed.&nbsp; The ball movement from one end of the ground to the other was as fast as I have seen from this group, and what was most encouraging was how well all players got involved.&nbsp; A fantastic all round team effort.</div>
</div>
<div id="r12" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 12</h3>
<div>Vs Endeavour Hills</div>
<div>Round 12 saw us head out to Endeavour Hills for a second time this season.&nbsp; Over the past few weeks I have spoken with the team about the importance each of their individual roles plays in contributing to the whole team.&nbsp; Everyone was very clear before taking to the ground what their roles would be and how to play on the day.&nbsp; I set a task to our wings and rucks to build a wall when we had the ball in our forward line and it held amazingly well.&nbsp; Our defence stood solid when tested the whole game, and the whole team were great at getting first to the ball and in numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have really seen a lot to like in the past few weeks as everyone starts to embrace their own roles and start to own the positions they are playing.&nbsp; We have two big games to finish the year, which is going to be a great test to see how far we have come as a group.</div>

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<div>What a beautiful day for Round 1 as we played away against Boronia.&nbsp; During the week the team was lucky enough&nbsp;to have a training session with Malcolm Bangs focussed on tackling and how to win contested ball.&nbsp; It was very clear from the start that the lessons had been effective.&nbsp; I was really impressed with how well all of the kids went for the ball from the start.&nbsp; What I was most happy with was how fairly they did it - I don't remember seeing us give any free kicks for unfair tackles.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I thought the handballing and passing was really good today too.&nbsp; There were some really great team first moments where players would dish out a handball to a running teammate or look to pass further up the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am looking forward to a holiday, I am also a touch sad that we won't be playing next week as I am just really enjoying watching the team improve as individuals and collectively each week.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are in a great position as a team having 22 really capable players.&nbsp; Today we were in a position to help Boronia put a bigger team on the park and have a full team (we had 21 players to their 14).&nbsp; I was really happy that when I asked for volunteers each quarter to play for the opposition, I never had to tap anyone on the shoulder.&nbsp; I always had enough players to put their hand up to help.&nbsp; A big point I have raised with the kids this year is sportsmanship.&nbsp; I have put forward that above all, I want people to see this team as a group of great sportspeople.&nbsp; Seeing our players put their hands up then going out to give their all, even when in opposition colours makes me really proud.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Have a safe and enjoyable Easter Break.&nbsp; I can't wait to see everyone ready to get into round 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

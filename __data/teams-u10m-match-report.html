  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<div>What a beautiful day for Round 1 as we played away against Boronia.&nbsp; During the week the team was lucky enough&nbsp;to have a training session with Malcolm Bangs focussed on tackling and how to win contested ball.&nbsp; It was very clear from the start that the lessons had been effective.&nbsp; I was really impressed with how well all of the kids went for the ball from the start.&nbsp; What I was most happy with was how fairly they did it - I don't remember seeing us give any free kicks for unfair tackles.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I thought the handballing and passing was really good today too.&nbsp; There were some really great team first moments where players would dish out a handball to a running teammate or look to pass further up the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am looking forward to a holiday, I am also a touch sad that we won't be playing next week as I am just really enjoying watching the team improve as individuals and collectively each week.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are in a great position as a team having 22 really capable players.&nbsp; Today we were in a position to help Boronia put a bigger team on the park and have a full team (we had 21 players to their 14).&nbsp; I was really happy that when I asked for volunteers each quarter to play for the opposition, I never had to tap anyone on the shoulder.&nbsp; I always had enough players to put their hand up to help.&nbsp; A big point I have raised with the kids this year is sportsmanship.&nbsp; I have put forward that above all, I want people to see this team as a group of great sportspeople.&nbsp; Seeing our players put their hands up then going out to give their all, even when in opposition colours makes me really proud.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Have a safe and enjoyable Easter Break.&nbsp; I can't wait to see everyone ready to get into round 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br aria-hidden="true" />Cheers - Tim</div>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<div>VS.&nbsp; Belgrave South</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After a week off with the easter break, the kids were keen to get straight back in for round 2 at home against Belgrave South.&nbsp; This game held particular significance with a special ANZAC ceremony before the game.&nbsp; I spoke with the kids before the game (as Rob did on&nbsp; Friday) about what the ANZAC spirit is and the importance of fair play and sportsmanship on the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We were down 4 players, but still stepped up to provide 2 players each quarter to help even numbers out.&nbsp; It was also our first game on a full sized oval.&nbsp; With all of that, the kids went out and battled hard from the start against some pretty solid opposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br aria-hidden="true" /><br aria-hidden="true" />It was a tough contest from the first bounce, but our players were always up for the challenge with some significant efforts.&nbsp; This continued throughout the game as things got tougher each quarter.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Again I was really proud of everyone's efforts in the game.&nbsp; I thought they really did play with the ANZAC spirit I asked for and gave it a red hot go.&nbsp; I am really enjoying seeing the growth in a number of players and can't wait to get stuck into round 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I don't like to single out individuals specifically in my reports, however in this case, I want to congratulate our captain for the day Tigerlily who was incredible all game, and pushed all day to win herself the ANZAC medal as awarded by the opposition coach - before quickly running off to play U12 girls.&nbsp; Well done.</div>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<div dir="auto">Vs Endeavour Hills</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Today we headed out to Endeavour Hills to play the Eagles for round 3. It was the first game this season where we could play 18 vs 18 and not loan players to the opposition, so it definitely made my job on the bench a little easier.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">I set the team the challenge this week of being first to the ball and really emphasised this in training this week as well as before the game.</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">As with anything I have asked in games this year, the group responded so well. I felt that our attack at the ball was outstanding from the first bounce.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">There were a few tough challenges thrown our way throughout the game, but I felt again our group really responded incredibly well.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">I am becoming more proud each week of how the team shows up and represents the Bayswater jumper.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Bring on Round 4!&nbsp;</div>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
<div>vs Noble Park</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Firstly, Happy Mothers Day.&nbsp; It was a special day and our team wanted to make sure they all put on a special effort for their mums.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br aria-hidden="true" /><br aria-hidden="true" />We were playing at home to Nable Park and unfortunately with holidays and illness, we were down to 16 so for the first&nbsp;time this season, we were a little short.&nbsp; I asked for the team to really dig in and put together a big effor today with reduced numbers with a focus on being first to the ball and shepherding their teammates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From the first bounce everyone played to their fullest.&nbsp; I couldn't fault anyone's effort.&nbsp; Noble Park were a tough team too - very hard running and quite physical, but our group didn't hold back and kept pushing.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What I was most proud&nbsp;of throughout the match was how despite being challenged, our players kept going and held their heads high.&nbsp; This showed especially in the last quarter where they managed to keep the opposition goalless while adding a couple themselves.&nbsp; Where they could have been forgiven for dropping off a little through fatigue with a physical game and short numbers, they just didn't and battled hard to the final siren.&nbsp; Well done to everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

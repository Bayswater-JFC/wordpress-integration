  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>GAME DAY: SUNDAY 10<sup>TH</sup> APRIL<br />ROUND: 1<br />VENUE: HOME&nbsp;<br />OPPOSITION: UPPER FERNTREE GULLY&nbsp;</p>
<p>First game for our under 14 girls was a very physical and tough clash.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both teams had 14 players, and competed hard all game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our lack of defensive efforts to defend in the first quarter saw us trailing 14 &ndash; 0 at the first break.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The girls re grouped going into the second quarter, and we were able to kick our first goal, through first year player Olivia Halse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A very defensive game overall, and early in the last quarter the score was only 16 &ndash; 9 and we were behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;It did mean that from after quarter time, we outscored the opposition nine points to two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, during the last quarter we suffered a serious injury to Chloe Gosling and the game could not continue due an Ambulance being called.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chloe had only played a few games of footy and was showing amazing skills and footy knowledge, as one of our best performers in this game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the trainers and nurses that were on scene to assist while we waited for the ambulance to arrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are hoping for a speedy recovery for Chloe and I know all her team mates are thinking of her and her family as she recovers.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>What a start to the season our under 14 girls have had!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We started with 15 against 15 and one on the bench while our opposition SBL wolves, waited for a 16<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;player.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We scored two goals in the first quarter, with Gemma taking a great mark in the goal square late and converting.&nbsp;&nbsp;The umpire went down with a pulled hamstring and our opposition gained an extra three players so were able to rotate players off the bench.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second quarter was hard to watch as not only did Chloe suffer a second serious injury in consecutive games, her best mate Ella hurt her shoulder, meaning both players were unable to continue and were headed for medical treatment after the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish them all the best.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playing 14 against 14 for the second half we battled hard, however couldn&rsquo;t hold off a fast finishing opposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing out consistently for us was Matilda, Grace, Asha, Skye and summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our girls should be proud of their efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are playing in &lsquo;C&rsquo; grade as we have a lot of inexperienced players.&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turns out, the three players that SBL added at quarter time were all from their &lsquo;A&rsquo; grade team that had played earlier (one had even kicked four goals in that game)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep training hard girls &ndash; a win is not too far away.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div id="r03" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<div>
<p>V South Croydon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first away game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had a really good training session during the week, and took this momentum into the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Down one player in three of the four quarters, we started really strong, kicking two goals in the first quarter and then another one in both the second and third quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading four goals to none going into the last quarter, South Croydon pushed hard but we held on to win 28 to 16 at the final siren.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest key to this match was the contribution of everyone in the team.&nbsp;&nbsp;When every player contributes, it is easier to find success as a team.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to Jess Willcocks for playing the second half after her under 12 game, swapping in for Matilda who headed to the under 16 game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goal kickers today &ndash; Shaylee 2, Olivia, Matilda&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best players &ndash; Everyone today, including the injured girls not playing.</p>
</div>

<div id="r04" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 4</h3>
<p>Away to Boronia at Miller Park.&nbsp;&nbsp;We had 16 players and were advised Boronia had 15, but when the game started, they only had 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;We evened up the numbers as they had some late arrivals, before playing 16 for each team.&nbsp;&nbsp;A special game for us as it was Shaylee&rsquo;s 50<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;game.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The open spaces in the first quarter suited us and we scored three first quarter goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our 50 game player was in everything early and helped us get off to a flying start.&nbsp;&nbsp;We swapped players around in the second quarter in an effort to have all girls involved, Gemma had a great second quarter playing great defence as Boronia had their best quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our third and fourth quarters were very strong as all the girls got involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mia, Carly and Ella running hard on the wings, Asha, Keely and Milly attacking every contest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Matilda getting reward for all her efforts kicking a great running goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jade pushing hard in the last quarter when we needed to keep the pressure on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great four quarter game by Marley, Grace and Skye who led the way to ensure we were the team singing the song and having a win on a memorable day for Shaylee, who was in the play with them all day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our best win for the season, final score 43 to 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly there were heaps of smiles all day as everyone enjoyed the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goal kickers &ndash; Grace, Shaylee, Marley, Summer, Matilda and Skye&nbsp;</p>

<div id="r05" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 5</h3>
<div>
<p>Round five at home against Chirnside Park.&nbsp;&nbsp;We played at Pinks Reserve Kilsyth on the main ground and whilst we had 15 to begin the game, Jess and Raelene came from the under 12 game to help out from the second quarter &ndash; thanks girls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We got off to a great start kicking three goals in the first quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our starting midfield with Marley, Shaylee and Jade were dominating and we managed to play in our forward line majority of the quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the second quarter we had a new midfield group, with Olivia taking over the ruck duties from Skye and Milly, Grace and Summer running on the ball.&nbsp;&nbsp;We stayed on top in the second quarter adding another goal. And Chirnside were yet to score.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being able to help out each other and do what is required of the team has been a real focus point for our girls so far this season, and it is definitely starting to pay off.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more talk, more commitment and effort given is excellent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even kicking against a strong wind in the last quarter we played great team footy.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were still running really hard for each other, with some outstanding efforts from Ella and Asha.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A comfortable win, 34 &ndash; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal kickers &ndash; Shaylee 3, Marley and Jade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best players &ndash; again a great team effort, led by Marley, Shaylee, Skye, Asha, Keely, Grace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we had another ambulance called, this time for Skye who suffered a head knock, but by Sunday night was home from hospital and feeling slightly better.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three ambulance incidents in the first five rounds, so hopefully we have had our share for the remainder of the season.</p>

  <h3>Round 6</h3>
<p>Vs Norwood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We knew this was going to be a tough game as Norwood hadn&rsquo;t lost a game and it proved that way from the start.&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcomed two new players, Liv and Saanvi and our captain for today was Summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visibly taller, our opposition took advantage of their size, and were able to break away from the clearances and move the ball forward quite easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were outscored 43 to 1 point at half time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the credit of our girls, they kept trying and increased the intensity of the game in the second half.&nbsp;&nbsp;We won the third quarter, 3 points to 1, and then only conceded two late goals in the final quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;A great effort, as we could have easily let the opposition run away with the game in the second half.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great four quarter effort from Marley, some inspirational moments from Keely, Summer and Asha, were all parts of todays game that we can be proud of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Final scores &ndash; Norwood 57 &ndash; Bayswater 4&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best players &ndash; Matilda, Marley, Asha, Keely, jade and Summer&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 8</h3>
<p>V Upper Ferntree Gully was always going to be a tough clash.&nbsp;&nbsp;Celebrating Skye and Graces 50<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;games, it was a special occasion for our team.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also Olivia Halse&rsquo;s last game for the season as she is off on a family holiday to warmer places.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately we started slow letting UFG kick two early goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Competing hard in the second quarter, Matilda, Skye and Grace defended really well and we were able to stop the opposition scoring a goal in the second quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;However we weren&rsquo;t able to make the most of our forward opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;For todays game it may have been a case of too few left to do too much.&nbsp;&nbsp;We play really well and the results go our way when we all contribute and when everyone has their mind in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third and fourth quarter were very similar to the first two.&nbsp;&nbsp;We did score a goal in the last quarter, due to some great forward movement and marking skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was finished by a really good set shot goal from Matilda.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A little more endeavour for the ball from more, and overall improvement in our kicking and marking will see us do better against teams of this calibre.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also must BELIEVE we are better. &nbsp;</p>
<p>End result UFG 37 &ndash; Bayswater 7 (Two dubious umpiring decisions for goals where the opposition kicked the ball off the ground &ndash; the rule for U14 girls says you cant kick the ball off the ground)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best players today &ndash; Matilda, Skye, Grace, Asha, Ella, Gemma.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div id="r09" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 9</h3>
<p>VERSE SBL WOLVES AT HOME &nbsp;</p>
<p>A great day for footy, with the sun shining and everyone fresh from a week off.&nbsp;&nbsp;We lost Gemma the night before to illness, however had Raelene and Jess coming across from the under 12&rsquo;s that were playing away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playing against a team that hadn&rsquo;t won a game, we were mindful not to take them for granted.&nbsp;&nbsp;We started off really strong kicking a couple of early goals in the first quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strong form continued in the second quarter as we kicked another couple of goals, however we also kicked a lot of points.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were getting a lot of opportunity through some great midfield work from Marley, Matilda and Shaylee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the stand out moments from todays game were things we have been practicing at training.&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of shepherding to help our team mates, handballing to a running player, and taking the game on by running with the ball.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we went on to kick another 5 goals in the second half, it was really great to see these things consistently being done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some stand moments from todays game:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Milly and Saanvi&rsquo;s shepherding.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Liv and Asha running with the ball.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Skye and Charlotte sharing the ruck duties, and Grace having a go also.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Shaylee&rsquo;s hunger for a goal, her determination is second to none.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Marleys on field direction and encouragement to her team mates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>A great win, that we needed to ensure we worked for.&nbsp;&nbsp;Final score Baysie/Kilsyth 71 &ndash; SBL 7&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goal kickers: Shaylee 4, Jess 2, Grace, Asha, Milly, Summer&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best players: For such a big win, everyone was involved and played really well together.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>GAME DAY: SUNDAY 10<sup>TH</sup> APRIL<br />ROUND: 1<br />VENUE: HOME&nbsp;<br />OPPOSITION: UPPER FERNTREE GULLY&nbsp;</p>
<p>First game for our under 14 girls was a very physical and tough clash.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both teams had 14 players, and competed hard all game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our lack of defensive efforts to defend in the first quarter saw us trailing 14 &ndash; 0 at the first break.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The girls re grouped going into the second quarter, and we were able to kick our first goal, through first year player Olivia Halse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A very defensive game overall, and early in the last quarter the score was only 16 &ndash; 9 and we were behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;It did mean that from after quarter time, we outscored the opposition nine points to two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, during the last quarter we suffered a serious injury to Chloe Gosling and the game could not continue due an Ambulance being called.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chloe had only played a few games of footy and was showing amazing skills and footy knowledge, as one of our best performers in this game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the trainers and nurses that were on scene to assist while we waited for the ambulance to arrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are hoping for a speedy recovery for Chloe and I know all her team mates are thinking of her and her family as she recovers.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>What a start to the season our under 14 girls have had!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We started with 15 against 15 and one on the bench while our opposition SBL wolves, waited for a 16<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;player.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We scored two goals in the first quarter, with Gemma taking a great mark in the goal square late and converting.&nbsp;&nbsp;The umpire went down with a pulled hamstring and our opposition gained an extra three players so were able to rotate players off the bench.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second quarter was hard to watch as not only did Chloe suffer a second serious injury in consecutive games, her best mate Ella hurt her shoulder, meaning both players were unable to continue and were headed for medical treatment after the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish them all the best.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playing 14 against 14 for the second half we battled hard, however couldn&rsquo;t hold off a fast finishing opposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing out consistently for us was Matilda, Grace, Asha, Skye and summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our girls should be proud of their efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are playing in &lsquo;C&rsquo; grade as we have a lot of inexperienced players.&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turns out, the three players that SBL added at quarter time were all from their &lsquo;A&rsquo; grade team that had played earlier (one had even kicked four goals in that game)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep training hard girls &ndash; a win is not too far away.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<div>
<p>V South Croydon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first away game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had a really good training session during the week, and took this momentum into the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Down one player in three of the four quarters, we started really strong, kicking two goals in the first quarter and then another one in both the second and third quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading four goals to none going into the last quarter, South Croydon pushed hard but we held on to win 28 to 16 at the final siren.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest key to this match was the contribution of everyone in the team.&nbsp;&nbsp;When every player contributes, it is easier to find success as a team.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to Jess Willcocks for playing the second half after her under 12 game, swapping in for Matilda who headed to the under 16 game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goal kickers today &ndash; Shaylee 2, Olivia, Matilda&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best players &ndash; Everyone today, including the injured girls not playing.&nbsp;</p>

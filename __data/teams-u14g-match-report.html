  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>GAME DAY: SUNDAY 10<sup>TH</sup> APRIL<br />ROUND: 1<br />VENUE: HOME&nbsp;<br />OPPOSITION: UPPER FERNTREE GULLY&nbsp;</p>
<p>First game for our under 14 girls was a very physical and tough clash.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both teams had 14 players, and competed hard all game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our lack of defensive efforts to defend in the first quarter saw us trailing 14 &ndash; 0 at the first break.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The girls re grouped going into the second quarter, and we were able to kick our first goal, through first year player Olivia Halse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A very defensive game overall, and early in the last quarter the score was only 16 &ndash; 9 and we were behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;It did mean that from after quarter time, we outscored the opposition nine points to two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, during the last quarter we suffered a serious injury to Chloe Gosling and the game could not continue due an Ambulance being called.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chloe had only played a few games of footy and was showing amazing skills and footy knowledge, as one of our best performers in this game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the trainers and nurses that were on scene to assist while we waited for the ambulance to arrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are hoping for a speedy recovery for Chloe and I know all her team mates are thinking of her and her family as she recovers.&nbsp;</p>

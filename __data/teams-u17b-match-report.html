  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p><strong>Vs Blackburn</strong></p>
<div dir="auto">A tough hit out today against a well drilled Blackburn side.</div>
<div dir="auto">Our lads really had a dip especially after QTR time and got better as the match went on.</div>
<div dir="auto">We are lucky enough to have secured four or five new players and we know it will take a little time to gel as a team.</div>
<div dir="auto">We will improve by training hard and practicing our running game, of which we saw a few glimpses of today.</div>
<div dir="auto">Some great contributors today were Jack, Max Power, Joey, Jag, Nerius and Jayden W.</div>
<div dir="auto">Let's all get to training on Tuesday and work on improving our game.</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Lachie and Nic.&nbsp;</div>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>Vs Wantirna South.</p>
<div>A much better hit out today where our lads were more&nbsp;switched on than Round 1.</div>
<div>Competing hard at the contest, strong tackling and a&nbsp;willingness to take the game on.&nbsp;Anzac match, and Coops 100th seemed to spur the lads&nbsp;on.</div>
<div>You are all starting to believe in yourselves lads and not&nbsp;just accepting losses.</div>
<div>A win will not be too far away.</div>
<div>Well done.</div>
<div>Better players were Jack, Kodi, Cooper, Jayden, Nerius, Jag,</div>
<p>Ethan and Lachie M.</p>
</div>
<div id="r04" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 4</h3>
<p>Vs Fair Park.</p>
<div dir="auto">Not a great way to go into a match with 5 players not available which left us without a bench.</div>
<div dir="auto">After QTR time the lads got into gear and matched it with Fair Park for the remainder of the game.</div>
<div dir="auto">Ultimately the lack of any interchange was the difference in being really competitive.</div>
<div dir="auto">Commitment from the whole team is required week in week out to be available even if carrying a slight injury or feeling not 100 percent.</div>
<div dir="auto">The advantage of well organised interchange is so important at this age group in Footy.</div>
<div dir="auto">Better players were Kodi, Cooper, Joey, Power, Jaydog and Alex.</div>
</div>
<div id="r05" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 5</h3>
<p>Much improved performance from the lads today.</p>
<div dir="auto">Big Nic had the boys matching it with the opposition for much of the game.</div>
<div dir="auto">Some players were in different positions than normal and performed pretty well.</div>
<div dir="auto">Keep the path lads and we will celebrate a win very soon.</div>
<div dir="auto"><span class="markbyhar2684 LMEtD" data-markjs="true">Congrats</span>&nbsp;to Damo, who kicked his first goal for the club.</div>
<div dir="auto">Better players, Kodi, Power, Jack, Tyler,&nbsp; and all the team.</div>

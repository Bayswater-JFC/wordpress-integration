  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p><strong>Vs Blackburn</strong></p>
<div dir="auto">A tough hit out today against a well drilled Blackburn side.</div>
<div dir="auto">Our lads really had a dip especially after QTR time and got better as the match went on.</div>
<div dir="auto">We are lucky enough to have secured four or five new players and we know it will take a little time to gel as a team.</div>
<div dir="auto">We will improve by training hard and practicing our running game, of which we saw a few glimpses of today.</div>
<div dir="auto">Some great contributors today were Jack, Max Power, Joey, Jag, Nerius and Jayden W.</div>
<div dir="auto">Let's all get to training on Tuesday and work on improving our game.</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>

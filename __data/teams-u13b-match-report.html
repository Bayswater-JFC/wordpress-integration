  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<div>Vs Blackburn Red</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Game 1 for the season 2022 was the complete opposite of last years round 1. There was no hail, no rain and no child deep puddles to contend with.&nbsp;</div>
<div>We were greeted with blue skies and perfect conditions.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Todays game was similar to the conditions. Picture perfect.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The team were celebrating the start of the season with the 50 game milestone of 2 of its players. And that inspiration was plenty to see them dig deep from the very first bounce.&nbsp;</div>
<div>With some quick ball movement and sensational teamwork the first quarter ended with Bayswater up 4 goals to 0.&nbsp;</div>
<div>From there the game was fairly even until the final siren with the first quarter setting up a fantastic win.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The perfect way to start the season. Great game Bayswater.&nbsp;</div>

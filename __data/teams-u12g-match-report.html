  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>v Boronia @ Tormore Reserve</p>
<div dir="auto">A cracking day with fantastic weather saw the U12 girls play Boronia on their home ground. The girls were very excited as this weeks captain, Jess.. led them onto the field to officially start their season.</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Boronia had close to a full squad, but due to injuries and player unavailability we only had 9 girls to play. After a chat with their coach, a shorter ground was deemed more suitable and he offered to give us 4 of their players each quarter to make up a 13 V 13 contest. This sportsmanship was obviously appreciated.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Boronia started well and was in control at quarter time. We came back in the second quarter to kick a few of our own goals but the scoreboard reflected their dominance on the ground at half time. After regrouping during the break.. the girls continued to try their best at the contest and push the ball forward but the relentless pressure from the opposition saw a lot of the play in our defence and more goals came as a result of this. We also lost Lily who came off injured after getting a knock in a contest.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Facing a large deficit at 3 qtr time I just reiterated our points from training that we focus on and reminded them of our #1 goal... Fun!</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Lily returned to play in the forward line for the last quarter but the ball didn&rsquo;t come down much as the goals kept coming for Boronia. Tigerlily also came off injured in the last as the game came to an end.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">In a game that was obviously one sided.. our girls tried hard all day and by the end of the game were exhausted. The temperature was in the high 20&rsquo;s during the game, so this.. combined with lack of personnel made it real tough for the girls in the end.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">We have a number of things we can take out of this game and look forward to our next game where we will continue to improve as a team!</div>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>Round 2 U12G v The Basin @ Home</p>
<div dir="auto"><span style="color: #313131;">Round 2 provided us with the opportunity to honour and reflect on the sacrifices made by our Anzac&rsquo;s! Seeing both teams lined up together, it was a truly moving moment!&nbsp;</span></div>
<div dir="auto"><span style="color: #313131;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div dir="auto"><span style="color: #313131;">We had some players back this week that missed round 1 in Raelene and Pippa. We also had Lexie who has joined us along with Gemma which was great to see üëçüèª Lily was our captain this week.. and did a fantastic job in leading her teammates!<br aria-hidden="true" /></span>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">It was a tight 1st quarter that was played in both 50 meter arc&rsquo;s! Ella started in the middle and took a number of marks from opposition kicks. Despite everyone&rsquo;s efforts.. our opponents headed into the first break a couple of goals ahead.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">In the 2nd quarter we continued to apply pressure around the contest and Jess, our leading goal kicker was able to slot a goal through out of the pack! Ella continued too mark anything that came her way, but our opposition were also able to add to their score and we went into half time a few goals down.</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">The third quarter seemed to be dominated by the opposition. Despite our efforts, we struggled to get the ball into our attacking 50 meter arc, the majority of the play being played in their half.</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">After the final break, the girls really fought hard to get the ball forward and keep it in our forward line to create opportunities to score. Unfortunately the ball spent a lot of time in our defensive 50. Raelene had been moved back into defence and took a number of intercepting marks and really provided some drive forward.. she was pivotal in stopping a number of their forward advances. Tigerlily also played in defence at the back of the pack and was able to stop a late goal from being scored.</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">The girls have again showed great resilience and kept playing till the end. I&rsquo;m very proud of their endeavour and I&rsquo;m sure we can be competitive in our future games!&nbsp;</div>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<p>V SBL @ Narre Warren East</p>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Today our girls took on South Belgrave/Lysterfield in their round 3 encounter! To even out the numbers between both teams their coach offered to give us two players each quarter which was greatly appreciated. Our captain for today was Clara and she won the coin toss and decided to kick to the end that had a slight breeze advantage.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">The girls started off well with lots of pressure around the contest. They were able to kick 3 goals in the opening quarter which was a fantastic effort&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">SBL kicked back in the second to kick a few of their own to reduce the margin at half time. The pressure was fantastic, especially in the middle where a lot of girls were playing for the first time. This was great to see!</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Each team had their moments in the third quarter and were able to add to the scoreboard. The girls were in good spirits at the end of the quarter holding a two goal lead at the final break.</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">In a tough last quarter, SBL were able to chip away at our lead and with a couple of minutes to go, kicked a goal to take the lead. Unfortunately the girls ran out of time to get the lead back and lost by a couple of points.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Despite the Loss, this performance has been their most complete performance as a team. The workload was shared and the girls appear to be taking steps which will inevitably improve their individual games as the season goes on!</div>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
<p>This round is a BYE</p>
</div>
<div id="r05" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 5</h3>
<p>v Rowville @ Rowville</p>
<div dir="auto"><span style="color: #313131;">This round, our girls played Rowville on their home ground. Both teams had the same number of players which meant we didn&rsquo;t have to &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; opposition players to make an even contest this week. Our number of players has slowly been growing. New recruit Summer has joined the team and Ava is making good progress in her recovery and will hopefully play in coming weeks.&nbsp;</span>Our captain this week was Sienna.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Good conditions for footy, but a strong breeze blowing to the Southern end saw us kicking with the breeze despite Rowville winning the toss. The blustery conditions in the first quarter made field kicking at hitting targets hard. The girls made a good effort around the contest, but Rowville impacted the scoreboard to lead at the first break.</div>
<div dir="auto"><span style="color: #313131;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div dir="auto"><span style="color: #313131;">The wind didn&rsquo;t let up in the second and Rowville were able to add to their lead with the wind at their back. Throughout the quarter, our defence was able to rush a number of behinds.. that was pleasing to see, as it&rsquo;s something we touched on at training and the girls were able to apply it in the game when under pressure.</span></div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto"><span style="color: #313131;">Our only goal scored came against the trend of play and was definitely a highlight of the day for us. Three marks in succession down the ground from excellent kicks resulted in one of our best goals in the season to date.</span></div>
<div dir="auto"><span style="color: #313131;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div dir="auto"><span style="color: #313131;">Despite the efforts from all the girls.. the second half was one way traffic in regards to scoring and general possession of ball. As the game wore on, we found it harder to apply pressure on their ball carriers and were unable to get the ball heading forward which meant we were under a lot of defensive pressure.. The scoreboard probably reflected this in the end.</span></div>
<div dir="auto"><span style="color: #313131;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div dir="auto"><span style="color: #313131;">A lot to take out of this game, but despite the result.. the girls continue to work and improve and we will move on to round 6 with optimism!</span></div>

  <h3>Round 6</h3>
<p>V South Croydon @ Benson Oval</p>
<div>
<p>Round 6 saw us take on South Croydon at their home ground. With a squad of 20 players available for them.. we had to again borrow 2 players to even up the numbers. Tigerlily would be available after quarter time and Ruby withdrew late as she feeling sick. Fenix joined us for her first game and our captain for today&rsquo;s game was Raelene.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>A good suggestion from our parent helper/trainer Nick at training got me thinking and this week we would implement a game plan that would see players playing in their positions for 2 quarters.. instead of rotating every quarter. This would allow our players more time to understand the positions on the ground and how to play them as well as giving us the opportunity to keep players in positions that provided real strengths and opportunities for us.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The first half would be where the majority of scoring would take place, be it just a couple of goals. Lily was able to kick a fantastic goal after a lot of play in our forward 50. Numerous acts of pressure and &ldquo;1 percenter&rsquo;s&rdquo; were pleasing to see. Everything from shepherds and smothers as well as lots of tackles. Ella continued her ferocity around the ball with a number of big tackles.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The second half was played in the arc&rsquo;s with little scoring and brief transitions through the middle. Captain Raelene lead from the front and repelled many forward attacks from our opposition, also Taking crucial marks.. late in the game across half back. The ball was down near our 50 metre arc in the last minute but we were unable to score.. the game ending in a draw.. 2-1-13 a piece.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Cameron, our new assistant coach and myself will get together with the girls and continue to work on our pressure and skills with lots of opportunities ahead.</p>

  <h3>Round 7</h3>
<p>v Heathmont @ Home</p>
<p dir="auto">After a few weeks on the road, we were finally back at home for round 7. With both teams fielding 14 players, it promised to be a tight contest. Our team was led out today by their fearless captain Ella.</p>
<p>A very tight contest in the first quarter saw lots of tackles and play in the middle of the ground with both teams going into the first break without impacting the scoreboard.</p>
<p>Heathmont were able to score in the second to take a 7 pt lead into the main break, our girls still searching for their first scoring opportunity.</p>
<p dir="auto">An even third quarter saw both team&rsquo;s score a goal and a behind each. Our leading goal scorer Jess was able grab the ball and run through the opposition to kick a great goal. With only a small margin in it, we were confident going into the 4th quarter that we were still a chance to compete for our first win.</p>
<p>Like the first quarter.. the last was focused around the contested ball and unfortunately we weren&rsquo;t able to add to our score, a few behinds to our opponents sealed the win for them.</p>
<p dir="auto">A great team effort with lots of girls playing in different positions and accepting new challenges. Lily and Lexie shared ruck duties against a bigger bodied opponent and we&rsquo;re really important for us when competing in the midfield. Gemma also took her game to the next level with lots of tackles and pressure on the opposition. Next round we play our round 1 opponents and look to showcase how much we improved and evolved as a team in the last 8 weeks!</p>

  <h3>Round 8</h3>
<p class="x_p1"><span class="x_s1">v Boronia @ Home</span></p>
<p class="x_p1"><span class="x_s1">Just over half way through the season and this week we faced the team we played in&nbsp;<span class="x_Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>round 1. Keen to see how far we&rsquo;ve progressed as a team in the last 8 weeks and avenge that heavy loss. Our fearless captain for this game was Tigerlily.</span></p>
<p class="x_p1"><span class="x_s1">Since playing Boronia in round 1, we&rsquo;ve been able to acquire a number of new players which has been very pleasing. Our team, as a collective has also gained more&nbsp;experience and has progressed their learning over the next 7 weeks and we felt very confident going into the game!</span></p>
<p class="x_p1"><span class="x_s1">Sticking with our plan to play personnel in set positions for longer periods was clearly working for us, the girls were understanding their roles and responsibilities for the position the were playing. The contest in the first half was pretty even, however Boronia were able to get forward more often and took their opportunities to hit the scoreboard leading at half time by 18 points.</span></p>
<p class="x_p1"><span class="x_s1">We continued our effort around the contest in the second half but struggled to get the ball into the forward 50 to score. We were able to score a goal in the 4th qtr through Jess, after dodging some opponents she was able kick a great goal!</span></p>
<p class="x_p1"><span class="x_s1">The final result would see Boronia win by 22 points. We played this team back in round 1 and they won by 92 points. Their coach acknowledged our improvement which was also pleasing. A great team effort in my eyes with ALL girls competing hard all over the field. Our newest recruit Fenix had her best game to date and was also one of the best players on the field.</span></p>
<p class="x_p1"><span class="x_s1">We do have a week off before our next game against knox.. but I had already decided to schedule training like normal. As usual, almost all of the girls were there at training , in the cold..on their week off. This just shows their commitment.. their love and their desire to play this great game with their mates. The hot Milo&rsquo;s organised by the club after training may have also had something to do with it!</span></p>

  <h3>Round 9</h3>
<p class="x_p1"><span class="x_s1">v Knox @ Away</span></p>
<p class="x_p1"><span class="x_s1">This week, we would see the girls in their blue socks to support SOCKIT2MND as they took on knox at their home ground. It's such a great cause and it was awesome too see all our families get behind it&nbsp;</span><span class="x_s2">üíô</span><span class="x_s1">&nbsp;Our fearless Captain for this week was none other than Nina, the tackling machine!</span></p>
<p class="x_p1"><span class="x_s1">For the first time this year, we had more players available for this game than our opposition..a luxury not familiar to us. We had 14 and they had 13.. Ruby was off sick and Ava still pushing for a return from her injury. We would have an interchange for the first time this year.. with a 13 v 13 contest on field.</span></p>
<p class="x_p1"><span class="x_s1">Our opponents got the jump on us in the first quarter, able to run freely from contests and easily break.. or run around tacklers. They went into quarter time 28 points up.</span></p>
<p class="x_p1"><span class="x_s1">After addressing the girls at the break and asking for more effort around the ball.. there was an improvement in the second quarter. The girls chased harder and applied more pressure on their ball carrier. Knox only kicked the one goal in the second quarter which was an indication of our increased work rate. Unfortunately we were still yet to score ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="x_p1" dir="auto"><span class="x_s1">The 3rd quarter would see the girls continue to work harder and as a result we were finally able to hit the scoreboard. Jess was able to kick two great goals for us.. her ability to run around opponents&nbsp;</span>and kick straight while running at pace was impressive.</p>
<p class="x_p1"><span class="x_s1">Jess would also add a third to her tally in the last to continue her good goal kicking form this season. Raelene also laid a magnificent tackle in our defence which saw her opponent go to ground.. earning her a free kick.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="x_p1"><span class="x_s1">Plenty of highlights for us in the second half, but a slow start would see us go down 67 to 19. We gradually got better as the game went on.. but would hope for an more even team performance.. right from the start of the game. Back to training to practice our skills and work on our game.</span></p>

  <h3>Round 10</h3>
<p>v Norwood @ Home</p>
<p>This week we were back on our home turf to play Norwood. For the second week in a row we had an extra player and we&rsquo;re able to rotate players every 3 minutes off the bench which is helpful. For this game, we had our first set of Co-Captains, Ava and Summer would lead the girls this week, still searching for that first elusive win!</p>
<p>An even first term would see our opponents go into the first break ahead.. two goals to one. Jess was able to add to her season tally with another goal in a tight contest in the goal square.. her speed and quick thinking saw her kick our first goal!</p>
<p>The girls continued to try hard in the second but were unable to impact the scoreboard.. Norwood added another goal and a few behinds to extend their lead at half time in this low scoring game.</p>
<p>The third quarter saw Lily kick a great goal for us. Playing in the Ruck.. Lily was able to get forward and kick truly. It was the only score that quarter, meaning we won the quarter which was pleasing.</p>
<p>Upbeat and enthusiastic.. the girls went into the last quarter needing to score a few more goals to steal a win. With lots of good contests all over the ground, both team were only able to add a behind to the scoreboard, Norwood taking a 9 point Victory.</p>
<p>Another great team performance this week! Lots of girls gaining confidence and getting into the game and the contest. We will continue to work and improve our skills over the next month. We have a number of match&rsquo;s against top teams to round out our year which will definitely provide more challenges.</p>

  <h3>Round 11</h3>
<p>V Heathmont @ Away</p>
<p>This week we were away, playing another team for the second time. Heathmont had a narrow win in our first encounter at home and we were keen to put in another solid effort and try and get that first win!</p>
<p>Our fearless captain this week was Pippa!</p>
<p>The Heathmont coach had been in contact with me earlier in the week expressing his concern about his numbers available for the game. Injuries, Covid/Cold and flu as well as school holidays would end up impacting both teams. We had 12 girls and they had 8, so we agreed to give them 2 girls each quarter to make it a 10 v 10 contest.</p>
<p>Our girls were on from the start with lots of pressure and effort in the opening quarter. With the majority of the play being in our forward half we were able to kick 2 goals and keep Heathmont goalless. Regular contributor Jess continued her great form in front of the sticks kicking a goal. Clara plays a lot of footy in defence for us but she was able to drift forward and take a great mark in front of goal. Keeping her composure she was able to go back and kick truly for her first goal of the season!</p>
<p>We continued to work hard at the contest in the second quarter and we&rsquo;re able to score another goal before half time to take a promising lead into the big break.</p>
<p>The focus at half time was about continuing to play with effort around the contest.. the girls kept playing a great brand of footy which meant we could add another goal to the scoreboard while keeping them scoreless. Lily was able to add to her season tally with a great goal.</p>
<p>Confident heading into the last quarter we knew we just had to play like the previous three quarters.. and we did. Lots of communication on the field and lots of effort from ALL girls would see a final goal from Jess and our first win for the season!!</p>
<p>Challenging day for both teams, personnel wise but a great effort from our girls to play 4 complete quarters of team footy!</p>
<p>They belted out the team song with plenty of gusto! So nice to see them get some reward for all the effort they&rsquo;ve put in throughout the season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have 3 very tough games coming up to round out our season, but if the girls can play the way they did this week, they&rsquo;ll give themselves every opportunity to get some more wins!</p>

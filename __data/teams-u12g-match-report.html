  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>v Boronia @ Tormore Reserve</p>
<div dir="auto">A cracking day with fantastic weather saw the U12 girls play Boronia on their home ground. The girls were very excited as this weeks captain, Jess.. led them onto the field to officially start their season.</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Boronia had close to a full squad, but due to injuries and player unavailability we only had 9 girls to play. After a chat with their coach, a shorter ground was deemed more suitable and he offered to give us 4 of their players each quarter to make up a 13 V 13 contest. This sportsmanship was obviously appreciated.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Boronia started well and was in control at quarter time. We came back in the second quarter to kick a few of our own goals but the scoreboard reflected their dominance on the ground at half time. After regrouping during the break.. the girls continued to try their best at the contest and push the ball forward but the relentless pressure from the opposition saw a lot of the play in our defence and more goals came as a result of this. We also lost Lily who came off injured after getting a knock in a contest.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Facing a large deficit at 3 qtr time I just reiterated our points from training that we focus on and reminded them of our #1 goal... Fun!</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Lily returned to play in the forward line for the last quarter but the ball didn&rsquo;t come down much as the goals kept coming for Boronia. Tigerlily also came off injured in the last as the game came to an end.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">In a game that was obviously one sided.. our girls tried hard all day and by the end of the game were exhausted. The temperature was in the high 20&rsquo;s during the game, so this.. combined with lack of personnel made it real tough for the girls in the end.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">We have a number of things we can take out of this game and look forward to our next game where we will continue to improve as a team!</div>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>Round 2 U12G v The Basin @ Home</p>
<div dir="auto"><span style="color: #313131;">Round 2 provided us with the opportunity to honour and reflect on the sacrifices made by our Anzac&rsquo;s! Seeing both teams lined up together, it was a truly moving moment!&nbsp;</span></div>
<div dir="auto"><span style="color: #313131;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div dir="auto"><span style="color: #313131;">We had some players back this week that missed round 1 in Raelene and Pippa. We also had Lexie who has joined us along with Gemma which was great to see üëçüèª Lily was our captain this week.. and did a fantastic job in leading her teammates!<br aria-hidden="true" /></span>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">It was a tight 1st quarter that was played in both 50 meter arc&rsquo;s! Ella started in the middle and took a number of marks from opposition kicks. Despite everyone&rsquo;s efforts.. our opponents headed into the first break a couple of goals ahead.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">In the 2nd quarter we continued to apply pressure around the contest and Jess, our leading goal kicker was able to slot a goal through out of the pack! Ella continued too mark anything that came her way, but our opposition were also able to add to their score and we went into half time a few goals down.</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">The third quarter seemed to be dominated by the opposition. Despite our efforts, we struggled to get the ball into our attacking 50 meter arc, the majority of the play being played in their half.</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">After the final break, the girls really fought hard to get the ball forward and keep it in our forward line to create opportunities to score. Unfortunately the ball spent a lot of time in our defensive 50. Raelene had been moved back into defence and took a number of intercepting marks and really provided some drive forward.. she was pivotal in stopping a number of their forward advances. Tigerlily also played in defence at the back of the pack and was able to stop a late goal from being scored.</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">The girls have again showed great resilience and kept playing till the end. I&rsquo;m very proud of their endeavour and I&rsquo;m sure we can be competitive in our future games!&nbsp;</div>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<p>V SBL @ Narre Warren East</p>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Today our girls took on South Belgrave/Lysterfield in their round 3 encounter! To even out the numbers between both teams their coach offered to give us two players each quarter which was greatly appreciated. Our captain for today was Clara and she won the coin toss and decided to kick to the end that had a slight breeze advantage.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">The girls started off well with lots of pressure around the contest. They were able to kick 3 goals in the opening quarter which was a fantastic effort&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">SBL kicked back in the second to kick a few of their own to reduce the margin at half time. The pressure was fantastic, especially in the middle where a lot of girls were playing for the first time. This was great to see!</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Each team had their moments in the third quarter and were able to add to the scoreboard. The girls were in good spirits at the end of the quarter holding a two goal lead at the final break.</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">In a tough last quarter, SBL were able to chip away at our lead and with a couple of minutes to go, kicked a goal to take the lead. Unfortunately the girls ran out of time to get the lead back and lost by a couple of points.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Despite the Loss, this performance has been their most complete performance as a team. The workload was shared and the girls appear to be taking steps which will inevitably improve their individual games as the season goes on!</div>

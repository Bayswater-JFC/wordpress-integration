  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>v Boronia @ Tormore Reserve</p>
<div dir="auto">A cracking day with fantastic weather saw the U12 girls play Boronia on their home ground. The girls were very excited as this weeks captain, Jess.. led them onto the field to officially start their season.</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Boronia had close to a full squad, but due to injuries and player unavailability we only had 9 girls to play. After a chat with their coach, a shorter ground was deemed more suitable and he offered to give us 4 of their players each quarter to make up a 13 V 13 contest. This sportsmanship was obviously appreciated.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Boronia started well and was in control at quarter time. We came back in the second quarter to kick a few of our own goals but the scoreboard reflected their dominance on the ground at half time. After regrouping during the break.. the girls continued to try their best at the contest and push the ball forward but the relentless pressure from the opposition saw a lot of the play in our defence and more goals came as a result of this. We also lost Lily who came off injured after getting a knock in a contest.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Facing a large deficit at 3 qtr time I just reiterated our points from training that we focus on and reminded them of our #1 goal... Fun!</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Lily returned to play in the forward line for the last quarter but the ball didn&rsquo;t come down much as the goals kept coming for Boronia. Tigerlily also came off injured in the last as the game came to an end.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">In a game that was obviously one sided.. our girls tried hard all day and by the end of the game were exhausted. The temperature was in the high 20&rsquo;s during the game, so this.. combined with lack of personnel made it real tough for the girls in the end.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">We have a number of things we can take out of this game and look forward to our next game where we will continue to improve as a team!</div>

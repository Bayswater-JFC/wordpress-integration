  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<div>Sunday was our first game of the season and a new team. The boys and girls were super excited to play and we had a number of players playing their first ever&nbsp;game.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Our coaches noticed some really great passages of play, which will continue improving over the season.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Our focus for the first few games is on field unity and working on a new game style. We expect this to take a few training sessions and games.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although the overall result didn't go our way, we didn't give up at any stage which is a credit to the team in their first competitive hit out.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There are a few areas for improvement, which will be a focus over the next few training sessions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cheers</div>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>We set goals in this game to be more competitive that our first game. We also introduced a defensive structure game plan that will be focused over the next 4 rounds. We feel that getting the defensive side of our game right is a priority right now.</p>
<p>Our pressure during this game was off the charts, although the ball was in our defensive zone for a majority of the game, we kept them to seven goals for the game.</p>
<p>Our focus as coaches is to continue work on repetitive basics over the coming 3-4 weeks, while working on some basic game day structure.</p>
<p>Overall, the effort displayed by all players during this game was outstanding.</p>
</div>
<div id="r03" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<p>Again, our focus during this game was to bring relentless pressure and effort to our game. We have been working on defensive structure over the past two week and we have seen come our on game day. Our back line has been outstanding under constant pressure and our midfielders have been providing great support to our back line.</p>
<p>While we didn&rsquo;t get off to the greatest start, we kept the opposition to 3 goals after quarter time and the ease in which we are being scored on has mostly stopped.</p>
<p>We identified a few key areas to focus on at training this week, in addition to continuing with the basics.</p>
<p>There were several connected plays on the weekend and a willingness to take a risk and switch the play. These are all great signs of the improvement made in the first 3 rounds and as coaches we can see the players wanted to improve.</p>
<p>This was another round were the coaches couldn&rsquo;t fault the effort and we all feel the team is not far away from competing on the score board.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div id="r04" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 4</h3>
<p><strong>Vs Upper FTG</strong></p>
<p>This week was a real test for us, we wanted to show the first 3 games had been building towards something and the structure being put in place was working.</p>
<p>Our first half wasn&rsquo;t ideal, we started off a bit slowly, but we took a positive from this half and that was scoring our first point. This seemed to spur on the team, after not scoring for 12 straight quarters outscored Upper FTG in the second half keeping their scoreless in the final quarter.</p>
<p>Again our back line held strong and our structure of playing along the wings worked. Our mid field supported both the back line and forward line, seeing some amazing individual on-field performances</p>
<p>Our second half was outstanding, which was seen by their effort and scoreboard reward. Although we fell short, this was a game were every position succeeded.</p>
<p>Every week there is constant improvement and the belief amongst this team is growing. &nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 5</h3>
<p><strong>Vs Vermont</strong></p>
<p>After our first 4 rounds, we were relegated to D division. This was expected, but the team to their credit and after renewed confidence from the last round came out with real intent. We were coming up against an undefeated side.</p>
<p>Our first quarters haven&rsquo;t been strong this season but the team came out and applied pressure straight away, keeping the overall scoring in the first half relatively even.</p>
<p>The oranges at half time must&rsquo;ve been great as the team kicked 4 goals straight to no score in the third quarter and 1 goal 1 behind in the last quarter, running out winners by 30 points.</p>
<p>The energy in the room after the game was electric. This team has worked so hard over the past 5 weeks, constantly improving week in, week out. It was a thoroughly deserved win.</p>
</div>
<div id="r06" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 6</h3>
<p>V The Basin</p>
<p>The confidence in the team was high after their first win and it could be felt in the club rooms before the game. The team now has a taste of victory and they wanted to continue winning. The game was played with high energy, effort and intent.</p>
<p>We can see the team is really connecting, creating great unity on the ground.</p>
<p>Our first quarters haven&rsquo;t been the greatest, so our real focus this week was to change this. The team came out with this in mind and to their credit they won the first quarter.</p>
<p>The second, third and fourth quarters we played with the same energy level and we could really see the confidence in the team building further and the confidence of individual players. The key take away from these quarters was their voice. In previous games their voice on the field has been low. As their confidence grew so did the level of their voice.</p>
<p>We came away with another win, making it back-to-back wins. It was a great game to watch and see everyone enjoying the game.</p>

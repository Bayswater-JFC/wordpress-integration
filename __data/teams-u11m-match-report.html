  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<div>Sunday was our first game of the season and a new team. The boys and girls were super excited to play and we had a number of players playing their first ever&nbsp;game.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Our coaches noticed some really great passages of play, which will continue improving over the season.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Our focus for the first few games is on field unity and working on a new game style. We expect this to take a few training sessions and games.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although the overall result didn't go our way, we didn't give up at any stage which is a credit to the team in their first competitive hit out.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There are a few areas for improvement, which will be a focus over the next few training sessions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cheers</div>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>We set goals in this game to be more competitive that our first game. We also introduced a defensive structure game plan that will be focused over the next 4 rounds. We feel that getting the defensive side of our game right is a priority right now.</p>
<p>Our pressure during this game was off the charts, although the ball was in our defensive zone for a majority of the game, we kept them to seven goals for the game.</p>
<p>Our focus as coaches is to continue work on repetitive basics over the coming 3-4 weeks, while working on some basic game day structure.</p>
<p>Overall, the effort displayed by all players during this game was outstanding.</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<p>Again, our focus during this game was to bring relentless pressure and effort to our game. We have been working on defensive structure over the past two week and we have seen come our on game day. Our back line has been outstanding under constant pressure and our midfielders have been providing great support to our back line.</p>
<p>While we didn&rsquo;t get off to the greatest start, we kept the opposition to 3 goals after quarter time and the ease in which we are being scored on has mostly stopped.</p>
<p>We identified a few key areas to focus on at training this week, in addition to continuing with the basics.</p>
<p>There were several connected plays on the weekend and a willingness to take a risk and switch the play. These are all great signs of the improvement made in the first 3 rounds and as coaches we can see the players wanted to improve.</p>
<p>This was another round were the coaches couldn&rsquo;t fault the effort and we all feel the team is not far away from competing on the score board.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<div>Sunday was our first game of the season and a new team. The boys and girls were super excited to play and we had a number of players playing their first ever&nbsp;game.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Our coaches noticed some really great passages of play, which will continue improving over the season.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Our focus for the first few games is on field unity and working on a new game style. We expect this to take a few training sessions and games.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although the overall result didn't go our way, we didn't give up at any stage which is a credit to the team in their first competitive hit out.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There are a few areas for improvement, which will be a focus over the next few training sessions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cheers</div>
<div>Ben</div>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>We set goals in this game to be more competitive that our first game. We also introduced a defensive structure game plan that will be focused over the next 4 rounds. We feel that getting the defensive side of our game right is a priority right now.</p>
<p>Our pressure during this game was off the charts, although the ball was in our defensive zone for a majority of the game, we kept them to seven goals for the game.</p>
<p>Our focus as coaches is to continue work on repetitive basics over the coming 3-4 weeks, while working on some basic game day structure.</p>
<p>Overall, the effort displayed by all players during this game was outstanding.</p>
</div>
<div id="r03" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<p>Again, our focus during this game was to bring relentless pressure and effort to our game. We have been working on defensive structure over the past two week and we have seen come our on game day. Our back line has been outstanding under constant pressure and our midfielders have been providing great support to our back line.</p>
<p>While we didn&rsquo;t get off to the greatest start, we kept the opposition to 3 goals after quarter time and the ease in which we are being scored on has mostly stopped.</p>
<p>We identified a few key areas to focus on at training this week, in addition to continuing with the basics.</p>
<p>There were several connected plays on the weekend and a willingness to take a risk and switch the play. These are all great signs of the improvement made in the first 3 rounds and as coaches we can see the players wanted to improve.</p>
<p>This was another round were the coaches couldn&rsquo;t fault the effort and we all feel the team is not far away from competing on the score board.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div id="r04" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 4</h3>
<p><strong>Vs Upper FTG</strong></p>
<p>This week was a real test for us, we wanted to show the first 3 games had been building towards something and the structure being put in place was working.</p>
<p>Our first half wasn&rsquo;t ideal, we started off a bit slowly, but we took a positive from this half and that was scoring our first point. This seemed to spur on the team, after not scoring for 12 straight quarters outscored Upper FTG in the second half keeping their scoreless in the final quarter.</p>
<p>Again our back line held strong and our structure of playing along the wings worked. Our mid field supported both the back line and forward line, seeing some amazing individual on-field performances</p>
<p>Our second half was outstanding, which was seen by their effort and scoreboard reward. Although we fell short, this was a game were every position succeeded.</p>
<p>Every week there is constant improvement and the belief amongst this team is growing. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div id="r05" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 5</h3>
<p><strong>Vs Vermont</strong></p>
<p>After our first 4 rounds, we were relegated to D division. This was expected, but the team to their credit and after renewed confidence from the last round came out with real intent. We were coming up against an undefeated side.</p>
<p>Our first quarters haven&rsquo;t been strong this season but the team came out and applied pressure straight away, keeping the overall scoring in the first half relatively even.</p>
<p>The oranges at half time must&rsquo;ve been great as the team kicked 4 goals straight to no score in the third quarter and 1 goal 1 behind in the last quarter, running out winners by 30 points.</p>
<p>The energy in the room after the game was electric. This team has worked so hard over the past 5 weeks, constantly improving week in, week out. It was a thoroughly deserved win.</p>
</div>
<div id="r06" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 6</h3>
<p>V The Basin</p>
<p>The confidence in the team was high after their first win and it could be felt in the club rooms before the game. The team now has a taste of victory and they wanted to continue winning. The game was played with high energy, effort and intent.</p>
<p>We can see the team is really connecting, creating great unity on the ground.</p>
<p>Our first quarters haven&rsquo;t been the greatest, so our real focus this week was to change this. The team came out with this in mind and to their credit they won the first quarter.</p>
<p>The second, third and fourth quarters we played with the same energy level and we could really see the confidence in the team building further and the confidence of individual players. The key take away from these quarters was their voice. In previous games their voice on the field has been low. As their confidence grew so did the level of their voice.</p>
<p>We came away with another win, making it back-to-back wins. It was a great game to watch and see everyone enjoying the game.</p>
</div>
<div id="r07" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 7</h3>
<p>V Lysterfield</p>
<p>After coming off two wins in a row, we were aiming for our third. We really wanted to focus on our first quarters again as we have been starting slowly on the scoreboard. Again, we were slow off the mark conceding the first goal, but we came back strong towards the end of the last quarter.</p>
<p>Our second and last quarters have been our strongest over the past month, scoring a majority of weekly scores in these quarters.</p>
<p>Our back line has been super consistent over the past 3 rounds, only conceding 3 goals. This couldn&rsquo;t be achieved without the great efforts by our midfield group getting back to help out.</p>
<p>Our midfield have worked so well together over the past 4 weeks, with all players rotating through this area working together to get clearance and making it harder for the opposition to get easy possessions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our forwards are now seeing more of the ball, attacking the goals and converting their opportunities. They are starting to work on their leading patterns, which will come but will take time.</p>
<p>As coaches, we only ask the team to play with effort and intent knowing the rewards will come. The team has achieved this in every game. We can see the results in the way they play as a group.</p>
<p>During the game against Lysterfield we wanted to focus on the 1 percenters, specifically holding their positions and not crowding the ball, and providing shepherds allowing their teammates to run. We noticed some improvement here and we&rsquo;ll continue to see improvement in the weeks to come.</p>
<p>Overall, we had a great win, making it three in a row. We have a challenging week coming up playing the ladder leaders who are undefeated. The way we have been playing I know the team are looking forward to the challenge.</p>
</div>
<div id="r08" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 8</h3>
<p>V Nth Ringwood</p>
<p>North Ringwood were going to be a real test for us. It would show where we were positioned as a team. The pre-game feel was great, the focus was to start strong and play a more defensive style initially, with the aim to be in a competitive position by half time.</p>
<p>While we started strongly this didn&rsquo;t show on the scoreboard and by half-time we were down by 29 points and 37 points at 3 quarter time. The team played some positive football executing their skills very well.</p>
<p>The conversation at three quarter time was to win the last quarter, to come away from the game with something positive. The team achieved this goal, by keeping them scoreless, while kicking 2 goals.</p>
<p>Overall, there were a lot of positives that came of the game and the team really felt they could compete with the ladder leaders.</p>
</div>
<div id="r09" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 9</h3>
<p>V Montrose</p>
<p>We came up against Montrose after the Queens Birthday long weekend. We wanted to start off with momentum we had built up against North Ringwood. Although we were quickly bought back to ground with Montrose competing extremely well and locking the ball in the forward half for most of the first quarter.</p>
<p>The first three quarters were very even, with only 4 points in it at three quarter time. A big effort in this game by Ollie, kicking three goals and high fiving his family on the way through.</p>
<p>Our final quarter saw us extend our lead coming away 11 point winners.</p>
<p>Overall, this was a great team game, the pressure, shepherding and tackling in this game was outstanding. Our forwards and backline pressed up very well where needed, making it hard for Montrose to score, but creating opportunity for us down forward.</p>
</div>
<div id="r10" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 10</h3>
<p>V Vermont</p>
<p>We were now full of confidence coming into this game, after a hard fought win the week before. The pre-game discussion was to continue playing the same style of game that has worked for us so far this season.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the team we just not on today, although we played some great passage of football we seemed to let Vermont back into the game and our defensive pressure wasn&rsquo;t there today. Vermont set up very well behind the ball creating multiple opportunities.</p>
<p>Although we didn&rsquo;t play well we were in the game the whole day and we were unlucky not to come away with a win, just missing a goal with less than a minute to go.</p>
<p>It was encouraging to see that we were still competitive with a top side even when we weren&rsquo;t playing our best.</p>
</div>
<div id="r11" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 11</h3>
<p>V Blackburn</p>
<p>We had now dropped out of the top 4 for the first time since dropping to this division, so the team really wanted to win, getting them back into the top 4.</p>
<p>We started very well in the first quarter, which haven&rsquo;t been our strongest this season, trailing by 2 points at quarter time.</p>
<p>The second quarter got away from us, with Blackburn building a lead which they retained, the rest of the game was very even scoring wise.</p>
<p>This week we noticed the team was off again with some of our game styles not working as well as we would like. Our defensive pressure was really good during this game, with Kirby taking some really strong marks.</p>
<p>As coaches, we felt the team played well in patches, we need to focus on more consistency throughout the game to remain competitive with the top sides.</p>
<p>Knowing that we hadn&rsquo;t played to our full potential over the past two week, yet remaining really competitive is really pleasing.</p>

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>How good was Round 1 footy! To start the season playing on our home ground for the first time in the glorious sunny weather, we couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better start for our under 9's. The coaches were super impressed with the team wearing their Bayswater jumpers with pride, many with new numbers and some new players for their first time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Emmalee and Levi T were nominated as captains to start us off for the season and led us out of the changerooms and on to the ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 7 vs 7 game format for each of the two games allowed the kids to move in space with less congestion, and plenty of touches of the footy. We saw a flurry of goals at different parts of the game and were impressed with the players handballing to bring their teammates into the game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the small dimensions of the ground, we encourage the kids take big kick towards our goal to clear the congestion and gain the ground advantage. However, if an opposing player is blocking the way, go for a run with the ball or look for a sideways handball if a teammate is in a better position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The kids played their positions very well and we didn&rsquo;t see too many players drifting into spaces they were not positioned. Great start team. Have a great Easter long weekend break.&nbsp;We look forward to welcoming back the players that missed round 1.</p>
<p>Go Baysie!&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>Round 2 saw us travel to South Belgrave who hosted the Anzac Day tribute before the game which was good for the under 9&rsquo;s to acknowledge and show their respect for the Anzacs. Both games were played in the right spirit. Our team showed great link up plays with lots of handballs creating movement of the footy in the right direction. Handballing has certainly improved from our first practice match a few weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also seeing the kids play their position well, which is a noticeable improvement from last year when players from all positions would swarm the ball. It was encouraging to see forwards leading into space, rather than waiting for the ball to bounce their way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Claire kicked her first goal for the season, which was one of the highlights of the day. Caleb and Wes have also figured out the right approach to smother kicks from the opposition, a technique we will all learn as a team at our next training. We will also continue to work on carrying the ball from a congested area to get a clearing kick. The delay in ball movement makes it easier for the opposition to crowd the ball carriers&rsquo; space, so we want to get the kids to make quick decisions with ball in hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congratulations to Dallas who played his first game for Bayswater. Well done team, a great bunch of kids to coach. See you at training.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div id="r03" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<p>We were back home to play Upper Ferntree Gully. Both teams were evenly matched with similar number of players and would have been a pretty even scoreline (if we scored of course). We had beautiful conditions for footy and both games were played in the right spirit. Our captains for the day were Rylie and Eli who both led their teams from the front. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We saw some great passages of play, with ball the moving from the back line to our scoring end of the ground without the opposition touching the ball. The kids are looking for their teammates in space rather than the usual big bombs down the line. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the game we spoke about looking to move the ball through the middle of the ground in open space rather than follow the outer wings. In the third quarter, Jacob had the ball in the back pocket and waited for Hamish to lead to the middle of the ground, before kicking to space and finding Hamish all alone. It was a great example of kicking to space and staying on the move to find space all alone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage all the kids to make quick decisions with footy in hand, rather than wait and get into trouble with too many opposition players crowding their space. Usually, the first option is the best option, whether a quick kick or run and carry. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite not being able to tackle, we teach the kids to defend the opposition ball carrier with hands and bodies in the way, blocking their path or smothering their kick. We are seeing some effective defensive efforts to help turn the ball over and we want to see more of the kids stay involved in the play when our team doesn&rsquo;t have the ball. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Well done team, see you at training.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div id="r04" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 4</h3>
<p>We travelled to Wantirna South to play the Devils on Mother&rsquo;s day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope all of the mothers enjoyed their special day and thank you for giving up your start to the day by getting the kids to the footy. Wantirna South certainly were tough opposition and played a high standard of footy, comfortably the best team we have faced so far this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a slow start I was impressed with my team&rsquo;s effort to get back in the contest and we had good passages of play moving the ball our way and finding the goals. Shout out to Archer for his captain&rsquo;s goal, inspiring the team and impressing us all, with Archer more than happy to relive the moment at the halftime break with a huge smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daniel&rsquo;s team was left a player down in the first quarter with Levi getting injured (Get well soon Levi) which caused some shuffling to the magnet boards. However, we were impressed with the team&rsquo;s effort to carry on and put their best efforts into the contest. Josh played an outstanding game taking plenty of marks and hitting the scoreboard with multiple goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will work on our defensive side of our game at training to help us turn the ball over when the opposite is in possession of the ball.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See you at training!&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div id="r05" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 5</h3>
<p>Another impressive game from our under 9 superstars. We matched up really well against Rowville Knights, both games going goal for goal and played in the right spirit.</p>
<div>It was good to see improvement in the defensive aspects of the game. A shoutout to the some of the important defensive efforts by Eli and Dallas, sticking to their opponents and running to get in the way. Fred was on the move all day and Ved had a great play kicking across the opponents&rsquo; goal to find a teammate.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div>A highlight in my game was when our captain for the day, Ben, kicked a long bomb from the centre that bounced and bounced ... and bounced through for a goal. The entire team all contributed in their different positions and attacked the contest with great effort.</div>
<div>For Daniel&rsquo;s game, the team were asked to move the ball by hand and they responded with some really great passages linking up via handball by Brodie, Hamish and Levi.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div>Heath and Emmalee moved the ball by hand as well and following it up with some great second efforts. Claire kicked a goal today and attacked the footy which was great to see. Wes had a good first half running the ball well and snapping long kicks towards goal.</div>
<p>It was pleasing to see the whole team taking on instructions and playing as a team. Well done, Kangas!</p>
</div>
<div id="r06" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 6</h3>
<p><span dir="auto">A chilly start to the Sunday for our under 9&rsquo;s, with the kids taking a while to warm up. Lysterfield were a strong team in both games and we had our work cut out for us to get our hands on the ball.</span></p>
<div dir="auto">Prior to the game Levi F presented the Welcome to Country to the team in the changeroom, which was a nice touch for the Sir Douglas Nicholls round in the AFL.</div>
<div dir="auto">We had some nice passages of play as a result of clearing kicks from the middle. We look good when we are able to move the ball quickly and to space for our forwards. Ben and Hamish showed some good dash out of the middle and Levi T also showed some flair with his run and attack on the ball. Anmar and Ved wore the captain armbands for their teams. Anmar closing the game in the 4th quarter with a superb set shot goal. I feel the goal umpire may have briefly had an obstructed view, but the team, coaches and spectators all cheered the great goal.</div>
<div dir="auto">Thank you to all the parent helpers today.</div>
<div dir="auto">Training this Friday, players ready to go @ 6:30pm. The ground is a hive of activity on Friday nights (Auskick, under 8&rsquo;s also using the field) so please make sure the kids can make their to the same area of the ground (Dandenong creek end) for our 6:30 warm-up. Thank you.</div>

  <h3>Round 7</h3>
<p>Our weekend footy fixture took us to play at Ferntree Gully. We had the luxury of playing on bigger footy fields and it was good to see the game played with less congestion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had a few injuries and niggles during the course of the game and the kids looked pretty puffed at times from running around in the bigger spaces. Kellan and Hamish wore the captain armbands and both led their respective teams brilliantly. The team are getting better applying pressure to their opponents and it was good to see some handballs out of trouble. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It was good to see the team get back to the club on Sunday night for our awards. Thanks to everyone who were able to make it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have reached the half-way point of the season and the kids have impressed us all with how much they have improved in 7 games. They all play together in the right team based spirit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the second half of the season we will start to introduce different games and drills aimed at getting the kids ready for under 10&rsquo;s football next year, where the games have less restrictions than the under 8/9&rsquo;s version and look more like the version they see on TV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go Baysie! &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div id="r08" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 8</h3>
<p>What a beautiful winter morning to play footy! The kids looked frozen at times but all got the message to keep moving to stay warm. Well done to Wes and Jacob for leading their teams as captains for the day. The kids seemed to enjoy playing in the wintry conditions with a long list of goalkickers for both teams. Was great to see so many goal celebrations from the kids after a few weeks of playing tough opposition. Well done to Fred who kicked his first goal, which was a ripper!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daniel and I have enjoyed watching the improvement of the kids in the first half of the year, particularly the first-year players whose confidence has grown each week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the second half of the season, we can look forward to playing some games as 1 team on bigger ground dimensions, which will be good to see the whole team play together for the first time. We will also start introducing different skills into training nights to help prepare us for next season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for all the parent helpers this morning and for all the helpers we get on training nights. The training drills work so much better and more beneficial for the kids when we have parent helpers on deck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go Baysie!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaun&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 9</h3>
<p>The kids looked fantastic in the blue socks today for MND awareness round. We raised over $300 as a team to go towards MND research which is a great outcome for the Bayswater Under 9&rsquo;s. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you all for getting behind this fundraising effort and thank you to Heather for organising the team this morning!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We matched up well against Rowville Hawks and the team and played great team footy. Josh played a great game as our captain for the day. The team come together brilliantly and we saw the kids look to handball to bring others into the game and plenty of high fives and encouragement for one another. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Go Baysie!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaun&nbsp;</p>

<div id="r10" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 10</h3>
<p>Well done to our under 9 champs who played their first game as one team. The kids enjoyed having a bigger field to play on with more freedom to go for a run and kick a long ball. The crowd went wild for Levi T&rsquo;s long bomb that kept bouncing and bouncing through for a goal. Well done to our courageous co-captains Jasper and Fred who led their team from the front.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In training we will take the kids through the additional positions on the ground (wing, half forward, half back) so they can learn where to start and where to run on the bigger field. We will also try bouncing the ball so we can use in games to run a bit further without being penalised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you to the parent helpers from today. Thank you also to Daniel for running the movie, snags, Milo and popcorn night last Friday &ndash; the kids got right into the AFL highlights showcasing superstars like Marcus Bontempelli and Aaron Naughton. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Just a reminder</u></strong>&nbsp;for the kids to bring their mouthguards on gameday. We can&rsquo;t let the kids take the field without a mouthguard, which we have to be pretty strict about. Boots, bottle and mouthguard is usually a final check at our house before we leave for the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enjoy the start of term holidays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaun&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 11</h3>
<p>We played South Belgrave for the second time this year, this time on our home deck. It was a chilly start to the morning with some kids wanting to wear their beanie in the game. Heath and Brodie both had the honour of wearing the captains arm bands and both played brilliant games. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We saw the kids take the game on and add to their running game by taking some bounces of the ball. This was the last game played as two separate teams and we will see the kids playing as single team for the remainder of the season on bigger grounds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It was great to see the kids enjoy kicking goals and celebrating with one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The kids have voted strongly in favour of playing on the bigger grounds and look forward to playing together as one team, all to help us prepare for next season as under 10&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go Baysie!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaun&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 12</h3>
<p><span dir="auto">An awesome effort from the kids which was our first game as one team using our home ground. I know the kids were pumped to play as one team for the remainder of the season.</span></p>
<div dir="auto">The fog and chill in the air was a bit confronting for the kids to start with but we shortly got them warmed up, thawed out and ready to go for the first quarter. It turned out to be a nice morning for footy.</div>
<div dir="auto">I enjoyed the passages of play where the kids linked up with handballs, sharing the ball, moving it forward and finishing with a goal or point. Too many names to mention, but we were very impressed with the way the kids adapted to the new positions, more numbers surrounding the footy and bigger field.</div>
<div dir="auto">We had a chat to the kids at quarter time about being respectful to the opposition, being good sports and it was good to see the kids take it on board.</div>
<div dir="auto">Thank you to Anmar, Archer, Caleb and Heath who each played a quarter for Upper FTG to help even up the numbers.</div>
<div dir="auto">I won&rsquo;t be at training on Friday night (neither will Daniel who will be coaching the under 7&rsquo;s &ndash; Good luck Dan) but we have a special guest coach who will take the kids for the night&hellip;. Drum roll &hellip;. James Holdstock! Thanks for stepping in James. If you are available and happy to join in, James would appreciate parent helpers on then night.</div>
<div dir="auto">See you all next Sunday!</div>

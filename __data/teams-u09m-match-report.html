  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>How good was Round 1 footy! To start the season playing on our home ground for the first time in the glorious sunny weather, we couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better start for our under 9's. The coaches were super impressed with the team wearing their Bayswater jumpers with pride, many with new numbers and some new players for their first time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Emmalee and Levi T were nominated as captains to start us off for the season and led us out of the changerooms and on to the ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 7 vs 7 game format for each of the two games allowed the kids to move in space with less congestion, and plenty of touches of the footy. We saw a flurry of goals at different parts of the game and were impressed with the players handballing to bring their teammates into the game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the small dimensions of the ground, we encourage the kids take big kick towards our goal to clear the congestion and gain the ground advantage. However, if an opposing player is blocking the way, go for a run with the ball or look for a sideways handball if a teammate is in a better position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The kids played their positions very well and we didn&rsquo;t see too many players drifting into spaces they were not positioned. Great start team. Have a great Easter long weekend break.&nbsp;We look forward to welcoming back the players that missed round 1.</p>
<p>Go Baysie!&nbsp;</p>

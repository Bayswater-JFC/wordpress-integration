  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>Great games today to all the boys.</p>
  <p>On a glorious Sunday morning in down town Croydon, the boys were pumped and ready to play.</p>
  <p>Our defense was strong, following the basics of getting in front, arms up and applying pressure.</p>
  <p>The midfield was amazing at getting the ball and boosting it to the forwards.</p>
  <p>The forwards really had some fun kicking a few 'sausage rolls' and getting around each other to celebrate.</p>
  <p>To think where the skills have accelerated from this time last year to now is absolutely amazing. The coaching team could not be prouder.</p>
  <p>Thankyou to all who came down to watch, help out and support the mighty Baysy Under 9 family.</p>
  <p>See you all Friday night ðŸ’šðŸ’›ðŸ’šðŸ’›</p>

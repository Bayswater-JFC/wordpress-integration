  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>How good was Round 1 footy! To start the season playing on our home ground for the first time in the glorious sunny weather, we couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better start for our under 9's. The coaches were super impressed with the team wearing their Bayswater jumpers with pride, many with new numbers and some new players for their first time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Emmalee and Levi T were nominated as captains to start us off for the season and led us out of the changerooms and on to the ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 7 vs 7 game format for each of the two games allowed the kids to move in space with less congestion, and plenty of touches of the footy. We saw a flurry of goals at different parts of the game and were impressed with the players handballing to bring their teammates into the game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the small dimensions of the ground, we encourage the kids take big kick towards our goal to clear the congestion and gain the ground advantage. However, if an opposing player is blocking the way, go for a run with the ball or look for a sideways handball if a teammate is in a better position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The kids played their positions very well and we didn&rsquo;t see too many players drifting into spaces they were not positioned. Great start team. Have a great Easter long weekend break.&nbsp;We look forward to welcoming back the players that missed round 1.</p>
<p>Go Baysie!&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>Round 2 saw us travel to South Belgrave who hosted the Anzac Day tribute before the game which was good for the under 9&rsquo;s to acknowledge and show their respect for the Anzacs. Both games were played in the right spirit. Our team showed great link up plays with lots of handballs creating movement of the footy in the right direction. Handballing has certainly improved from our first practice match a few weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also seeing the kids play their position well, which is a noticeable improvement from last year when players from all positions would swarm the ball. It was encouraging to see forwards leading into space, rather than waiting for the ball to bounce their way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Claire kicked her first goal for the season, which was one of the highlights of the day. Caleb and Wes have also figured out the right approach to smother kicks from the opposition, a technique we will all learn as a team at our next training. We will also continue to work on carrying the ball from a congested area to get a clearing kick. The delay in ball movement makes it easier for the opposition to crowd the ball carriers&rsquo; space, so we want to get the kids to make quick decisions with ball in hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congratulations to Dallas who played his first game for Bayswater. Well done team, a great bunch of kids to coach. See you at training.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
<p>We travelled to Wantirna South to play the Devils on Mother&rsquo;s day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope all of the mothers enjoyed their special day and thank you for giving up your start to the day by getting the kids to the footy. Wantirna South certainly were tough opposition and played a high standard of footy, comfortably the best team we have faced so far this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a slow start I was impressed with my team&rsquo;s effort to get back in the contest and we had good passages of play moving the ball our way and finding the goals. Shout out to Archer for his captain&rsquo;s goal, inspiring the team and impressing us all, with Archer more than happy to relive the moment at the halftime break with a huge smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daniel&rsquo;s team was left a player down in the first quarter with Levi getting injured (Get well soon Levi) which caused some shuffling to the magnet boards. However, we were impressed with the team&rsquo;s effort to carry on and put their best efforts into the contest. Josh played an outstanding game taking plenty of marks and hitting the scoreboard with multiple goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will work on our defensive side of our game at training to help us turn the ball over when the opposite is in possession of the ball.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See you at training!&nbsp;</p>

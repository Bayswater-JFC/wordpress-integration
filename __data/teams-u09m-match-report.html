  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>How good was Round 1 footy! To start the season playing on our home ground for the first time in the glorious sunny weather, we couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better start for our under 9's. The coaches were super impressed with the team wearing their Bayswater jumpers with pride, many with new numbers and some new players for their first time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Emmalee and Levi T were nominated as captains to start us off for the season and led us out of the changerooms and on to the ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 7 vs 7 game format for each of the two games allowed the kids to move in space with less congestion, and plenty of touches of the footy. We saw a flurry of goals at different parts of the game and were impressed with the players handballing to bring their teammates into the game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the small dimensions of the ground, we encourage the kids take big kick towards our goal to clear the congestion and gain the ground advantage. However, if an opposing player is blocking the way, go for a run with the ball or look for a sideways handball if a teammate is in a better position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The kids played their positions very well and we didn&rsquo;t see too many players drifting into spaces they were not positioned. Great start team. Have a great Easter long weekend break.&nbsp;We look forward to welcoming back the players that missed round 1.</p>
<p>Go Baysie!&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>Round 2 saw us travel to South Belgrave who hosted the Anzac Day tribute before the game which was good for the under 9&rsquo;s to acknowledge and show their respect for the Anzacs. Both games were played in the right spirit. Our team showed great link up plays with lots of handballs creating movement of the footy in the right direction. Handballing has certainly improved from our first practice match a few weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also seeing the kids play their position well, which is a noticeable improvement from last year when players from all positions would swarm the ball. It was encouraging to see forwards leading into space, rather than waiting for the ball to bounce their way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Claire kicked her first goal for the season, which was one of the highlights of the day. Caleb and Wes have also figured out the right approach to smother kicks from the opposition, a technique we will all learn as a team at our next training. We will also continue to work on carrying the ball from a congested area to get a clearing kick. The delay in ball movement makes it easier for the opposition to crowd the ball carriers&rsquo; space, so we want to get the kids to make quick decisions with ball in hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congratulations to Dallas who played his first game for Bayswater. Well done team, a great bunch of kids to coach. See you at training.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<p>We were back home to play Upper Ferntree Gully. Both teams were evenly matched with similar number of players and would have been a pretty even scoreline (if we scored of course). We had beautiful conditions for footy and both games were played in the right spirit. Our captains for the day were Rylie and Eli who both led their teams from the front. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We saw some great passages of play, with ball the moving from the back line to our scoring end of the ground without the opposition touching the ball. The kids are looking for their teammates in space rather than the usual big bombs down the line. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the game we spoke about looking to move the ball through the middle of the ground in open space rather than follow the outer wings. In the third quarter, Jacob had the ball in the back pocket and waited for Hamish to lead to the middle of the ground, before kicking to space and finding Hamish all alone. It was a great example of kicking to space and staying on the move to find space all alone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage all the kids to make quick decisions with footy in hand, rather than wait and get into trouble with too many opposition players crowding their space. Usually, the first option is the best option, whether a quick kick or run and carry. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite not being able to tackle, we teach the kids to defend the opposition ball carrier with hands and bodies in the way, blocking their path or smothering their kick. We are seeing some effective defensive efforts to help turn the ball over and we want to see more of the kids stay involved in the play when our team doesn&rsquo;t have the ball. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Well done team, see you at training.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
<p>We travelled to Wantirna South to play the Devils on Mother&rsquo;s day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope all of the mothers enjoyed their special day and thank you for giving up your start to the day by getting the kids to the footy. Wantirna South certainly were tough opposition and played a high standard of footy, comfortably the best team we have faced so far this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a slow start I was impressed with my team&rsquo;s effort to get back in the contest and we had good passages of play moving the ball our way and finding the goals. Shout out to Archer for his captain&rsquo;s goal, inspiring the team and impressing us all, with Archer more than happy to relive the moment at the halftime break with a huge smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daniel&rsquo;s team was left a player down in the first quarter with Levi getting injured (Get well soon Levi) which caused some shuffling to the magnet boards. However, we were impressed with the team&rsquo;s effort to carry on and put their best efforts into the contest. Josh played an outstanding game taking plenty of marks and hitting the scoreboard with multiple goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will work on our defensive side of our game at training to help us turn the ball over when the opposite is in possession of the ball.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See you at training!&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 5</h3>
<p>Another impressive game from our under 9 superstars. We matched up really well against Rowville Knights, both games going goal for goal and played in the right spirit.</p>
<div>It was good to see improvement in the defensive aspects of the game. A shoutout to the some of the important defensive efforts by Eli and Dallas, sticking to their opponents and running to get in the way. Fred was on the move all day and Ved had a great play kicking across the opponents&rsquo; goal to find a teammate.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div>A highlight in my game was when our captain for the day, Ben, kicked a long bomb from the centre that bounced and bounced ... and bounced through for a goal. The entire team all contributed in their different positions and attacked the contest with great effort.</div>
<div>For Daniel&rsquo;s game, the team were asked to move the ball by hand and they responded with some really great passages linking up via handball by Brodie, Hamish and Levi.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div>Heath and Emmalee moved the ball by hand as well and following it up with some great second efforts. Claire kicked a goal today and attacked the footy which was great to see. Wes had a good first half running the ball well and snapping long kicks towards goal.</div>
<p>It was pleasing to see the whole team taking on instructions and playing as a team. Well done, Kangas!</p>

  <h3>Round 6</h3>
<p><span dir="auto">A chilly start to the Sunday for our under 9&rsquo;s, with the kids taking a while to warm up. Lysterfield were a strong team in both games and we had our work cut out for us to get our hands on the ball.</span></p>
<div dir="auto">Prior to the game Levi F presented the Welcome to Country to the team in the changeroom, which was a nice touch for the Sir Douglas Nicholls round in the AFL.</div>
<div dir="auto">We had some nice passages of play as a result of clearing kicks from the middle. We look good when we are able to move the ball quickly and to space for our forwards. Ben and Hamish showed some good dash out of the middle and Levi T also showed some flair with his run and attack on the ball. Anmar and Ved wore the captain armbands for their teams. Anmar closing the game in the 4th quarter with a superb set shot goal. I feel the goal umpire may have briefly had an obstructed view, but the team, coaches and spectators all cheered the great goal.</div>
<div dir="auto">Thank you to all the parent helpers today.</div>
<div dir="auto">Training this Friday, players ready to go @ 6:30pm. The ground is a hive of activity on Friday nights (Auskick, under 8&rsquo;s also using the field) so please make sure the kids can make their to the same area of the ground (Dandenong creek end) for our 6:30 warm-up. Thank you.</div>

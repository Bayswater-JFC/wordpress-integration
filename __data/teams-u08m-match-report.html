  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<div><strong>Bayswater Green</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The under 8 Green team today showed great determination in a tough battle. It was great to welcome young Tommy into the side, after his cast was finally removed mid week. He has shown up to every training session and every game and was super excited to lace up the boots today.</div>
<div>The kids skills are growing each week and really improving.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Today we concentrated on our defensive pressure and it shows when the kids listen, the action's are louder than words.&nbsp;</div>
<div>A big thankyou to our team managers who are doing an amazing job, considering all the changes come game day.</div>
<div>Also to our parent volunteers/helpers. Couldn't do it without them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Regards</div>

Three weeks in now and I can see how the team are getting confortable with each other and having plenty of cheeky laughs&nbsp;<img title="Emoji" src="https://s.yimg.com/nq/yemoji_assets/latest/yemoji_assets/1f601.png" alt="Emoji" width="16" height="16" data-imagetype="External" /></div>
<div id="x_x_ydpbe98ef3byiv8007619600ms-outlook-mobile-signature" dir="ltr">It was clear the foundations of the game are better understood week on week, improving out of sight in such a short time frame.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="x_x_ydpbe98ef3byiv8007619600ms-outlook-mobile-signature" dir="ltr">This week at training we will spend some time focusing on our defensive actions when we do not have the ball. Its something our competing team did very well, we can too.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="x_x_ydpbe98ef3byiv8007619600ms-outlook-mobile-signature" dir="ltr">Thank you to the team managers, coaches, officials and parents that support each week.<br aria-hidden="true" /><span class="markktglsxtvg LMEtDboTwopWdh5S5P1E" data-markjs="true">Congratulations</span>&nbsp;to all our team on our first round up night together Sunday night.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="x_x_ydpbe98ef3byiv8007619600ms-outlook-mobile-signature" dir="ltr">Really proud of you all</div>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
<div>The green and gold team today showed great spirit in their battle with Vermont, undermanned but we had some fantastic support from Vermont so all the kids could get a run today.&nbsp;</div>
<div>At training we worked on some basic skills and it really showed today. We are really coming together as a group and the friendship's between the kids is really growing.</div>
<div>Our defensive pressure was outstanding, but yet on the other hand when in our forward line we looked for a handpass or kick to a fellow team member to kick a goal.&nbsp;</div>
<div>As a new coach's we are super happy with the kids today, and to get the mums, aunties, grandmas to join in with the club song was a touching experience.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cant thank Coach Mark and Coach Welchy, Michelle and Tristan enough for their amazing support and contribution and to all parent helpers and supporters.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Regards</div>

<div>The Gold and Green bayswater team showed great spriit today in what was our best team performance yet.

Very exciting to watch the U8's excitment as they see it all working and coming together.&nbsp;<img id="x_x_ymail_ctr_id_-250297-2" title="Emoji" src="https://s.yimg.com/nq/yemoji_assets/latest/yemoji_assets/1f44f.png" alt="Emoji" width="16" height="16" data-imagetype="External" /><img id="x_x_ymail_ctr_id_-792999-3" title="Emoji" src="https://s.yimg.com/nq/yemoji_assets/latest/yemoji_assets/1f44f.png" alt="Emoji" width="16" height="16" data-imagetype="External" /><img id="x_x_ymail_ctr_id_-835351-4" title="Emoji" src="https://s.yimg.com/nq/yemoji_assets/latest/yemoji_assets/1f44d.png" alt="Emoji" width="16" height="16" data-imagetype="External" /></div>
<div dir="ltr">We did have some throws the week prior and we focused on our handball work at training. Pleasing to see it take shape with no throws at all this week. Well done team.</div>
<div dir="ltr">In addition on Friday training we have worked on getting to the ball first and being relentless to obtain the ball. The boys were lightning fast and hungry today and adgetated our competition to get it back.</div>
<div dir="ltr">The wind picked up and I think the team really appreciated thier long sleeve Gurnseys&nbsp;<img id="x_x_ymail_ctr_id_-535998-5" title="Emoji" src="https://s.yimg.com/nq/yemoji_assets/latest/yemoji_assets/1f605.png" alt="Emoji" width="16" height="16" data-imagetype="External" />.</div>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<div><strong>Bayswater Green</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The under 8 Green team today showed great determination in a tough battle. It was great to welcome young Tommy into the side, after his cast was finally removed mid week. He has shown up to every training session and every game and was super excited to lace up the boots today.</div>
<div>The kids skills are growing each week and really improving.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Today we concentrated on our defensive pressure and it shows when the kids listen, the action's are louder than words.&nbsp;</div>
<div>A big thankyou to our team managers who are doing an amazing job, considering all the changes come game day.</div>
<div>Also to our parent volunteers/helpers. Couldn't do it without them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Regards</div>

Three weeks in now and I can see how the team are getting confortable with each other and having plenty of cheeky laughs&nbsp;<img title="Emoji" src="https://s.yimg.com/nq/yemoji_assets/latest/yemoji_assets/1f601.png" alt="Emoji" width="16" height="16" data-imagetype="External" /></div>
<div id="x_x_ydpbe98ef3byiv8007619600ms-outlook-mobile-signature" dir="ltr">It was clear the foundations of the game are better understood week on week, improving out of sight in such a short time frame.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="x_x_ydpbe98ef3byiv8007619600ms-outlook-mobile-signature" dir="ltr">This week at training we will spend some time focusing on our defensive actions when we do not have the ball. Its something our competing team did very well, we can too.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="x_x_ydpbe98ef3byiv8007619600ms-outlook-mobile-signature" dir="ltr">Thank you to the team managers, coaches, officials and parents that support each week.<br aria-hidden="true" /><span class="markktglsxtvg LMEtDboTwopWdh5S5P1E" data-markjs="true">Congratulations</span>&nbsp;to all our team on our first round up night together Sunday night.&nbsp;</div>

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<div>
<div>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Vs Wantirna south white<br />10am - Lewis oval.</p>
</div>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Well the weather couldn't of been any better for our under 8's first game of the year. Sun was shining, a little anxiety from the boys of what was to come, combned with excitment.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The game plan was simple: Get the ball and run towards our goals, no more than 10 meters (we measured out 10 meters before the game, so we all could see what was 10 meters was<img id="x__x0000_i1025" src="https://s.yimg.com/nq/yemoji_assets/latest/yemoji_assets/1f601.png" alt="Emoji" width="16" height="16" data-imagetype="External" />) and kick or handball as far as possible to your team mate.&nbsp; Lastley have as much fun as possible. We certainly had lots of fun.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Special call out to Tommy Delbridge who unfortuanly was not able to play due to an arm being in plaster. Not to worry, Tommy joined the officals and helped pick this weeks captain and vice captain, hand our half time lolly snake and share some easter eggs at the end of the game. Thank you Tommy for attending and supporting.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I was really proud of all the boys who put thier hand up to turn theier gurnsey inside out and play for the Wantirna team. This allowed us to have no interchange and everyone player play a full game.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">We ended with cheers for the umpire and our first go at the team song. Well done lads.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Thank you to all the families that came to support the first game and all the work put in to get us to that point.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I cant wait for our next game together. Well done U8 baysy</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<div><strong>Bayswater Green</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The under 8 Green team today showed great determination in a tough battle. It was great to welcome young Tommy into the side, after his cast was finally removed mid week. He has shown up to every training session and every game and was super excited to lace up the boots today.</div>
<div>The kids skills are growing each week and really improving.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Today we concentrated on our defensive pressure and it shows when the kids listen, the action's are louder than words.&nbsp;</div>
<div>A big thankyou to our team managers who are doing an amazing job, considering all the changes come game day.</div>
<div>Also to our parent volunteers/helpers. Couldn't do it without them.</div>

<div id="x_x_ydpbe98ef3byiv8007619600ms-outlook-mobile-signature" dir="ltr">It was so pleasing to see the Under 8 Gold and Green team having fun this morning. Three weeks in now and I can see how the team are getting confortable with each other and having plenty of cheeky laughs&nbsp;<img title="Emoji" src="https://s.yimg.com/nq/yemoji_assets/latest/yemoji_assets/1f601.png" alt="Emoji" width="16" height="16" data-imagetype="External" /></div>
<div id="x_x_ydpbe98ef3byiv8007619600ms-outlook-mobile-signature" dir="ltr">It was clear the foundations of the game are better understood week on week, improving out of sight in such a short time frame.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="x_x_ydpbe98ef3byiv8007619600ms-outlook-mobile-signature" dir="ltr">This week at training we will spend some time focusing on our defensive actions when we do not have the ball. Its something our competing team did very well, we can too.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="x_x_ydpbe98ef3byiv8007619600ms-outlook-mobile-signature" dir="ltr">Thank you to the team managers, coaches, officials and parents that support each week.<br aria-hidden="true" /><span class="markktglsxtvg LMEtDboTwopWdh5S5P1E" data-markjs="true">Congratulations</span>&nbsp;to all our team on our first round up night together Sunday night.&nbsp;</div>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
<div>The green and gold team today showed great spirit in their battle with Vermont, undermanned but we had some fantastic support from Vermont so all the kids could get a run today.&nbsp;</div>
<div>At training we worked on some basic skills and it really showed today. We are really coming together as a group and the friendship's between the kids is really growing.</div>
<div>Our defensive pressure was outstanding, but yet on the other hand when in our forward line we looked for a handpass or kick to a fellow team member to kick a goal.&nbsp;</div>
<div>As a new coach's we are super happy with the kids today, and to get the mums, aunties, grandmas to join in with the club song was a touching experience.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cant thank Coach Mark and Coach Welchy, Michelle and Tristan enough for their amazing support and contribution and to all parent helpers and supporters.&nbsp;</div>

<div>The Gold and Green bayswater team showed great spriit today in what was our best team performance yet.

Very exciting to watch the U8's excitment as they see it all working and coming together.&nbsp;<img id="x_x_ymail_ctr_id_-250297-2" title="Emoji" src="https://s.yimg.com/nq/yemoji_assets/latest/yemoji_assets/1f44f.png" alt="Emoji" width="16" height="16" data-imagetype="External" /><img id="x_x_ymail_ctr_id_-792999-3" title="Emoji" src="https://s.yimg.com/nq/yemoji_assets/latest/yemoji_assets/1f44f.png" alt="Emoji" width="16" height="16" data-imagetype="External" /><img id="x_x_ymail_ctr_id_-835351-4" title="Emoji" src="https://s.yimg.com/nq/yemoji_assets/latest/yemoji_assets/1f44d.png" alt="Emoji" width="16" height="16" data-imagetype="External" /></div>
<div dir="ltr">We did have some throws the week prior and we focused on our handball work at training. Pleasing to see it take shape with no throws at all this week. Well done team.</div>
<div dir="ltr">In addition on Friday training we have worked on getting to the ball first and being relentless to obtain the ball. The boys were lightning fast and hungry today and adgetated our competition to get it back.</div>
<div dir="ltr">The wind picked up and I think the team really appreciated thier long sleeve Gurnseys&nbsp;<img id="x_x_ymail_ctr_id_-535998-5" title="Emoji" src="https://s.yimg.com/nq/yemoji_assets/latest/yemoji_assets/1f605.png" alt="Emoji" width="16" height="16" data-imagetype="External" />.</div>

  <h3>Round 6</h3>
<p><span dir="auto">On a beautiful Sunday Melbourne Morning our Green and Gold boys took on Ferntree Gully.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div dir="auto">In only our 6th match as a team, the skills, the pressure, the effort, the reward is coming together fantastically.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">As coaches we are super proud of the boys and to have more and more parents and friends to come watch and support is amazing.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">At training we play a game at the end where the kids can't kick a goal until 5 possessions have been shared. This is starting to show on game day, where we are looking around for an opportunity.</div>
<div dir="auto">A big thankyou to Coach Welchy for jumping in to umpire as the EFNL were short.</div>

  <h3>Round 7</h3>
<div dir="ltr">What a pleasant day it was Sunday considering how wet it is now (monday) and this week. The sun was shinning and a tad crisp. Ideal U8 playing conditions. The boys were bouncing off the walls as per usual ready to play. It brings a smile to everyone to see them so excited to play each Sunday.</div>
<div dir="ltr">We were very fortunate to have just about the full team line up of 16 on Sunday. Very exciting.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr">The team continued working on our 3 simple strategies.:</div>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">Be first to the ball</li>
<li dir="ltr">Run as hard as you can towards our goals when you get the ball.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Kick or handball as long as you can towards goals, space and team mates etc......</li>
</ol>
<div dir="ltr">Simple but effective.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr">We misplaced the team song card this week that we usually hold up for the U8's to sing along too. Not to worry though, the U8's belted it out as strong as ever from heart</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr">Thank you to the coaching team, Michelle and Tristan and a big thank you for the contribution of our parent helpers and supporters.&nbsp;</div>

  <h3>Round 8</h3>
<div>On a morning where most of the kids and parents would have loved to stay in their cosy beds, we had almost two full teams with only 1 absent.&nbsp;</div>
<div>It was a crisp, windy, drizzly morning but that didn't stop the kids from doing what they love.</div>
<div>It is still mind boggling how the skills continue to develop week in week out.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Great determination and pressure in defence limited the opposition from scoring, but on the other hand our run and carry in offence was a stand out.</div>
<div>The kids are also looking for opportunities to handpass or kick if in trouble which is what we have been working on at training.&nbsp;</div>
<div>We love how the kids belt out the song with passion after every game. It shows they are all committed and truly a great bunch of mates.</div>
<div>Many thanks again to our support coaches, managers, parent helpers and all that came down to support in crazy cold conditions.&nbsp;</div>

  <h3>Round 9</h3>
<div dir="ltr">The mighty Bayswater vs Mitcham Tigers.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr">Fair to say after our bye week the team were ready to go. Smiles all round ready to meet the contest of the Mitcham tigers and have a lot of fun.</div>
<div dir="ltr">We couldn't ask for better winter weather as the wind had a holiday with the rain and the sun shone through.</div>
<div dir="ltr">A big thanks to Mitcham who were 22 strong and shared some of their team so all the team were able to play 100% match time.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr">Bayswater were first to the ball, ran hard, kicked long and were relentless to force errors when we didn't have the ball.</div>
<div dir="ltr">It was really pleasing to see the team handballing and passing to the others on our team who may not have had a lot of touches early. It really helps bring these players into the game and grow confidence.</div>
<div dir="ltr">Although we don't keep score and its all about fun, the boys know exactly how well we did and we left with the same smiled with arrived with.</div>
<div dir="ltr">Michelle, Tristian and Kobe had a well deserved break, a big thanks to Nat for stepping in. You were great, thank you.</div>

  <h3>Round 10</h3>
<div dir="auto">Bayswater vs Blackburn</div>
<div dir="auto">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Well winter is surely upon us, with the first real time the boys had to play in wet and cold conditions.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="auto">Many runny noses, red cold fingers, drenched clothes and soaked hair didnt stop the kids from enjoying their footy.</div>
<div dir="auto">With an undermanned Blackburn side it was great to see our kids help out and play with the opposition to have a fair game.</div>
<div dir="auto">Also with an umpire short Coach Mark and Coach Welchy helped out to umpire the gold team. Great work guys.</div>
<div dir="auto">Special call out to coach Zoran for taking the lead and organizing the boys each quarter while Coach Chris did some boundry line coaching.</div>
<div dir="auto">We set the boys a challenge this week to spread out, use their voices and call for an opportunity. Slowly but surely we got the hang of this and started to execute the plan.</div>
<div dir="auto">Once again as always Thankyou to all who came out and brave the conditions and allow the kids to play the sport they love.</div>

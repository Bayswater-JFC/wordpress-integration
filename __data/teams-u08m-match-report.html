  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Away vs Heathmont, won 67-20</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">We have been put up in B division after grading.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Today we came ready to play and focus on improving the things we didn&rsquo;t do so well last week.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">We put a lot of pressure on the opposition and started the game a lot tighter in defence. Our forwards worked hard and presented well resulting in goals.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">We had a little lapse where we were a bit loose enabling them to get a few goals and we tightened up again and finished off strong.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Best- Mikybie, Maddie, Georgie, Tara, Ami, Taylah, Rhani, Cassie</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Goals- Cassie 3, Sarah 2, Tara, Indah, Tilli, Mia.</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Away vs Ferntree Gully, lost 58-17</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Tough game today. We started really well. Good pressure, we presented well and worked hard all over the field resulting in us winning the first quarter.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From then on, the opposition lifted their game. The hit us hard, ran harder than us, wanted the ball more and we played a bit too loose so they were able to get the lead and win.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">We learned a lot from todays game that we will look to improve in the following weeks.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Goals- Mia, Tilli.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Best- Rana, Mia, Rhani, Claire, Taylah</p>

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p><strong>@ East Ringwood 10/4</strong></p>
<p>Our first game of the season was filled with excitement and unknowns. We&rsquo;ve set some team rules in place for the season and it was good to see the boys learning and embracing them. East Ringwood were a little short, using a few top up players from the U11s, but the boys still needed to stay switched on and focused, one of our rules and aims this year. The first quarter was a tussle with East Ringwood getting on top on the scoreboard by being first on the ball. A switch of Max into the ruck and Marley into the centre proved positive, and better team play saw us up at halftime 5.5 to 4.2. The second half was a better team effort, with all the boys getting in for the ball first and playing good, hard football. We ended up with a good win, and the pleasing thing was our defensive efforts in the second half. A highlight was Logan kicking four goals in his first game back in the team after his courageous battle last year! Great team effort to start the year</p>
<p>Final Scores: Bayswater 9.10. 64 to East Ringwood 4.4. 28</p>
<p>Goal kickers; Logan Raymond 4, Max Peters, Martin Woollard, Hamish Bithell, Owen Spencer, Izaac Tauiliili, 1 each</p>
<p>Best team players: Marley Parlby, Joel Gunn, Max Peters, Logan Raymond</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p><strong>V South Belgrave 24/4</strong></p>
<p>Our first home game of the year saw us take on South Belgrave, a team who got the better of us last year. A great start to the game saw the boys take an early lead and with good attack on the ball (led by Hamish) and great tackling, the boys were up at half time 4.3 to 2.0. Some great individual efforts from Aaron gave his teammates plenty of motivation. The second half saw more of the same, with the boys teaming well with handball, and Zac in particular leading the way with great teamwork when you don&rsquo;t have the ball. Teamwork is a key part of everything we do this year, and it was great to see Zac leading us. Really good teamwork and being first to the ball led us to a really good win against a good team.&nbsp;<span class="markddzoqi5yr LMEtD" data-markjs="true">Congratulations</span>&nbsp;to Tyler W for getting the Anzac medal from South Belgrave for being a great teammate (thanks to Max copping one in the nethers!! :-D )</p>
<p>Final Scores: Bayswater 6.8. 44 to South Belgrave 3.0. 18</p>
<p>Goal kickers: Mason Cullen 2, Max Peters, Tommy Walker, Izaac Tauiliili, and Dusty Moore 1 each</p>
<p>Best team players: Zac Tebby, Sam Davies, Aaron Busse, Mason Cullen, Tommy Walker</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<p><strong>V Waverley &ndash; 1/5</strong></p>
<p>A trip to Waverley for Round 3 and another slow start for our boys. Although some parts of our game were going well (our shepherding was really good) we had a few boys who were chasing kicks rather than holding their positions, and we were caught out a few times. The boys were rushing their disposals a bit as well, which wasn&rsquo;t helped by our lack of talk. At half time, though, we were leading 3.5. 23 to 1.1 7. The second half saw a much better effort from the boys in the team areas we focus on &ndash; talking, shepherding, and defending for your teammates. Some great football from some of our leaders in Tommy, Joel and Max helped get the results up forward, with great play from Landon and Izaac in particular. The boys managed to secure another good win, with the highlight almost being Hamish&rsquo;s great snap that turned into a pass to Izaac!</p>
<p>Final Scores: Bayswater 9.9. 63 to Waverley 2.1 13</p>
<p>Goal kickers; Tommy Walker, Owen Spencer, Izaac Tauiliili,2 each, Max Peters, Mason Cullen and Jack Pearson 1 each</p>
<p>Best team players: Joel Gunn, Mason Cullen, Jack Pearson, Landon White, Izaac Tauiliili,</p>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
<p><strong>V Heathmont&nbsp; 8/5</strong></p>
<p>Round 3 at home on Mother&rsquo;s Day saw us against a very good team in Heathmont, and after 3 straight wins it seemed we were a bit complacent. A disappointing first half as we were second to the ball, and Heathmont&rsquo;s chatter got under the skin of a few of our boys. At half time we were down 9.6 to 2.5. A talk at half time reminded the boys of one of our key team rules &ndash; control what we can. The boys remained more calm and played much more like the way we want to this year. We got our hands on the ball first a lot more (particularly in the third quarter) and led by Billy in the ruck, we were really competitive for the rest of the game. Another great game from Joel in defence as well.</p>
<p>Final Scores: Bayswater 4.9. 32 to Heathmont 10.14. 74</p>
<p>Goal kickers: Tommy Walker 2, Joel Gunn, Dusty Moore 1 each</p>
<p>Best team players: Billy Tournier, Joel Gunn, Tommy Walker, Dusty Moore</p>

  <h3>Round 5</h3>
<p><strong>V The Basin&nbsp; 15/5</strong></p>
<p>We ventured to The Basin in Round 5 and a big game for two of our leaders, Jack and Dusty who played their 50<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;games together. We asked the boys for an improved mental effort this week, particularly for our two milestone mates, and the boys responded really well. The Basin are a very good, physical team, and while they took it up to our boys physically, our mental strength was there to see, which is really pleasing. Being resilient on the footy field when things are tough or not going our way is a key to achieving success, and it&rsquo;s also a great took for life in general. In this regard, we were so proud of all the boys for the efforts they put in all game. We were getting hands on the ball first, but our disposal and work off the ball let us down a bit. At half time we were down by a point, 3.0 to 3.1. The second half saw a fitter Basin team move away from us a bit, but the boys never gave up in their efforts, and this will stand us in good stead for the rest of the season. Special mention to some big efforts by Josh, Hamish and Mason, and great games from Ashton, Joel and Martin.</p>
<p>Final Scores: Bayswater 3.2. 20 to The Basin 6.8. 44</p>
<p>Goal kickers; Martin Woollard 2, Logan Raymond 1</p>
<p>Best team players: Josh Toohey, Joel Gunn, Mason Cullen, Hamish Bithell, Ashton Eagles</p>

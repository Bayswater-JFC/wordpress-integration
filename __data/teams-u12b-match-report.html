  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<div>Sunday was our first game of the season and a new team. The boys and girls were super excited to play and we had a number of players playing their first ever&nbsp;game.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Our coaches noticed some really great passages of play, which will continue improving over the season.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Our focus for the first few games is on field unity and working on a new game style. We expect this to take a few training sessions and games.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although the overall result didn't go our way, we didn't give up at any stage which is a credit to the team in their first competitive hit out.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There are a few areas for improvement, which will be a focus over the next few training sessions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cheers</div>

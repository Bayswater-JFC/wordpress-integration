  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>First game for the year against East Ringwood at their ground.</p>
<p>We had a few girls play their first game for the club and a few play the first ever game.</p>
<p>It was a great day for footy but I also new East Ringwood were a strong side.</p>
<p>The effort from our girls from start to finish was really good. Unfortunately , East Ringwood were better structured and used the ball better than us resulting in them controlling more of the game.</p>
<p>We had a few good passages of play resulting in goals but fell short in the end.</p>
<p>This was a good experience for the girls and showed us where we need to improve and where the girls need to position themselves on the field.</p>
<p>We lost 56-21.</p>
<p>Goals. Gemma, Mia, Taylah</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>Looking to bounce back from round 1, today we played Endeavour Hills/Rowille at home.</p>
<p>The girls were switched on started the game well. They shared the ball around to create scoring opportunities, unfortunately our kicking accuracy was a bit off and we kicked a lot of points.</p>
<p>Our talking was much better this week and they played well for the whole 4 quarters.</p>
<p>Although we won very easily and already seeing improvements, we know what we need to keep working on to keep improving.</p>
<p>Great Anzac Day Sportsmanship.</p>
<p>We won 113-0.</p>
<p>Goals. Rhani 4, Cassie 2, Maddie 2, Gemma 2, Skye, Tianah, Jasmine, Matilda, Tilli</p>
<p>Best. Rhani, Mia, Hailey, Maddie, Gemma, Ami, Tilli, Taylah, Matilda, Jasmine.</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<p>Today we played Heathmont at their ground.</p>
<p>After training so well on Thursday night and knowing Heathmont is a strong side, I was really looking forward to the challenge today.</p>
<p>Our warm up was pretty good, it was just going to come down to which team wanted it more on the day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Heathmont started well and we didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Our forwards didn&rsquo;t position themselves well and clearly Heathmont wanted the ball and attacked the ball harder than than us resulting in our girls chasing them around the park.</p>
<p>I spoke at quarter time at what we needed to work on but we were unable to produce the goods we needed to turn things around.</p>
<p>We were trying, but just not hard enough or smart enough to change the momentum of the game.</p>
<p>Credit to the girls in the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;quarter. They played heaps better, presented well and we won that quarter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Heathmont controlled the last quarter and went on to win the game 69-21.</p>
<p>As a team, we really need to have a look at ourselves and look at ways to improve how we play. If we knuckle down and work a bit harder, I reckon we could see a lot of improvement, very quickly.</p>
<p>Hopefully we step up and bounce back next week.</p>
<p>cheers</p>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
<p>Today we played Ringwood North at home.</p>
<p>We were hoping to bounce back from last weeks loss. We trained really well on Thursday night so hoping for big things.</p>
<p>We started pretty well in the first quarter and it was fairly even but the other team just capitalised on a few of our mistakes to lead at quarter time.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, we just didn&rsquo;t work hard enough and were second to the ball so Ringwood North increased their lead. A pretty disappointing quarter for us.</p>
<p>With a bit of a razz up at half time, we played better than the first 2 quarters but we were unable to reduce the lead they had on us.</p>
<p>In the last quarter, we just didn&rsquo;t play well and Ringwood North having a lot more of the ball resulting is us losing 48-21.</p>
<p>We just need to increase our effort levels and improve our skills and we will play a lot better.</p>
<p>Goals. Tara 2, Mia.</p>
<p>Best. Maddie, Hailey, Tara, Mia, Ami, Shayla</p>

  <h3>Round 5</h3>
<p>We had a big chat this week with the girls to find out where they want to go this year and how much effort they want to put in. The last few weeks has shown their effort level and attitude down from where I think it should be. This was frustrating for the coaching group and the few players that were having a real go. They all agreed effort and attitude need to lift so this was good for us moving forward.</p>
<p>The girls came to the game pretty positive to turn things around and also play well for Rhani&rsquo;s 50<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;game.</p>
<p>We started the game well. Our talk and handballs were much better and even though we were kicking against the wind, we managed to outscore them. Our forwards presented well resulting in scoring opportunities.</p>
<p>We continued to play well in the second quarter and with long kicking and good sharing of the ball, we extended our lead.</p>
<p>We got a bit lazy in the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;quarter. Work rate, skills and talk were all down letting Knox capitalise and kick goals.</p>
<p>We bounced back well in the last quarter controlling most of the play and finished off with a good win.</p>
<p>Goals. Rhani 3, Cassie 2, Mia, Tara, Hailey, Tilli, Emliy, Jas.</p>
<p>Best. Maddie, Hailey, Shayla, Taylah, Mia, Rhani,</p>

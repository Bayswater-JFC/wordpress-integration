  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>First game for the year against East Ringwood at their ground.</p>
<p>We had a few girls play their first game for the club and a few play the first ever game.</p>
<p>It was a great day for footy but I also new East Ringwood were a strong side.</p>
<p>The effort from our girls from start to finish was really good. Unfortunately , East Ringwood were better structured and used the ball better than us resulting in them controlling more of the game.</p>
<p>We had a few good passages of play resulting in goals but fell short in the end.</p>
<p>This was a good experience for the girls and showed us where we need to improve and where the girls need to position themselves on the field.</p>
<p>We lost 56-21.</p>
<p>Goals. Gemma, Mia, Taylah</p>
<p>Best. Mia, Maddie, Taylah, Shayla, Ami</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>Looking to bounce back from round 1, today we played Endeavour Hills/Rowille at home.</p>
<p>The girls were switched on started the game well. They shared the ball around to create scoring opportunities, unfortunately our kicking accuracy was a bit off and we kicked a lot of points.</p>
<p>Our talking was much better this week and they played well for the whole 4 quarters.</p>
<p>Although we won very easily and already seeing improvements, we know what we need to keep working on to keep improving.</p>
<p>Great Anzac Day Sportsmanship.</p>
<p>We won 113-0.</p>
<p>Goals. Rhani 4, Cassie 2, Maddie 2, Gemma 2, Skye, Tianah, Jasmine, Matilda, Tilli</p>
<p>Best. Rhani, Mia, Hailey, Maddie, Gemma, Ami, Tilli, Taylah, Matilda, Jasmine.</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<p>Today we played Heathmont at their ground.</p>
<p>After training so well on Thursday night and knowing Heathmont is a strong side, I was really looking forward to the challenge today.</p>
<p>Our warm up was pretty good, it was just going to come down to which team wanted it more on the day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Heathmont started well and we didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Our forwards didn&rsquo;t position themselves well and clearly Heathmont wanted the ball and attacked the ball harder than than us resulting in our girls chasing them around the park.</p>
<p>I spoke at quarter time at what we needed to work on but we were unable to produce the goods we needed to turn things around.</p>
<p>We were trying, but just not hard enough or smart enough to change the momentum of the game.</p>
<p>Credit to the girls in the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;quarter. They played heaps better, presented well and we won that quarter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Heathmont controlled the last quarter and went on to win the game 69-21.</p>
<p>As a team, we really need to have a look at ourselves and look at ways to improve how we play. If we knuckle down and work a bit harder, I reckon we could see a lot of improvement, very quickly.</p>
<p>Hopefully we step up and bounce back next week.</p>
<p>cheers</p>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
<p>Today we played Ringwood North at home.</p>
<p>We were hoping to bounce back from last weeks loss. We trained really well on Thursday night so hoping for big things.</p>
<p>We started pretty well in the first quarter and it was fairly even but the other team just capitalised on a few of our mistakes to lead at quarter time.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, we just didn&rsquo;t work hard enough and were second to the ball so Ringwood North increased their lead. A pretty disappointing quarter for us.</p>
<p>With a bit of a razz up at half time, we played better than the first 2 quarters but we were unable to reduce the lead they had on us.</p>
<p>In the last quarter, we just didn&rsquo;t play well and Ringwood North having a lot more of the ball resulting is us losing 48-21.</p>
<p>We just need to increase our effort levels and improve our skills and we will play a lot better.</p>
<p>Goals. Tara 2, Mia.</p>
<p>Best. Maddie, Hailey, Tara, Mia, Ami, Shayla</p>

<div id="r05" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 5</h3>
<p>We had a big chat this week with the girls to find out where they want to go this year and how much effort they want to put in. The last few weeks has shown their effort level and attitude down from where I think it should be. This was frustrating for the coaching group and the few players that were having a real go. They all agreed effort and attitude need to lift so this was good for us moving forward.</p>
<p>The girls came to the game pretty positive to turn things around and also play well for Rhani&rsquo;s 50<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;game.</p>
<p>We started the game well. Our talk and handballs were much better and even though we were kicking against the wind, we managed to outscore them. Our forwards presented well resulting in scoring opportunities.</p>
<p>We continued to play well in the second quarter and with long kicking and good sharing of the ball, we extended our lead.</p>
<p>We got a bit lazy in the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;quarter. Work rate, skills and talk were all down letting Knox capitalise and kick goals.</p>
<p>We bounced back well in the last quarter controlling most of the play and finished off with a good win.</p>
<p>Goals. Rhani 3, Cassie 2, Mia, Tara, Hailey, Tilli, Emliy, Jas.</p>
<p>Best. Maddie, Hailey, Shayla, Taylah, Mia, Rhani,</p>

  <h3>Round 6</h3>
<p>We played Wantirna South at their small ground today.</p>
<p>The first 5 minutes started pretty well. It was pretty even and looked being a good challenge for us. After the first 5 minutes, you could tell Wantirna South wanted the ball more and they started to really take control of the quarter. When we had the ball, we didn&rsquo;t kick it nearly far enough and we turned it over too easily giving the other team too many easy possessions. We were definitely running second to the ball too often giving the other team first use.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it continued in the second quarter so the other team were getting a comfortable lead.</p>
<p>We turned things around in the third quarter. We manned up a lot tighter on their play makers, won the ball more often and kicked it long forward resulting in goals and outscoring the other team. In the last quarter, the other team just wanted the ball more and took control of the last quarter with the ball spending most of the quarter in their forward line.</p>
<p>We ended up losing 82-25.</p>
<p>Goals. Matilda, Taylah, Gemma, Renee.</p>
<p>Best. Ami, Gemma, Shayla, Mia, Maddie, Rhani, Matilda, Tara.</p>

  <h3>Round 7</h3>
<p>Today we played Ferntree Gully/Norwood at home.</p>
<p>It was Haileys 50<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;game so that definitely gave us some more incentive to play well and win.</p>
<p>We started the game well. The girls worked hard, won the ball, used it well, got into the right positions and worked hard in defence. Because of this, we had the lead at quarter time.</p>
<p>The second and third quarters were pretty similar to the first so we kept extending our lead until late in the third quarter where we looked to be slowing down resulting in the other team kicking a few quick goals.</p>
<p>We were still up at three quarter time but as we all know, a quarter of footy is a long time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us, as our opposition kept playing strong, hard footy, we were slowing down and cracks started to appear in our game.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t pick up opposition players enough or run hard enough enabling the opposition to get free and create scoring opportunities.</p>
<p>We ended up losing by 1 goal. 41-35.</p>
<p>A much better game by the girls but we just need to play 4 good quarters, not 3.</p>
<p>Best. Maddie, Hailey, Jas, Matlida, Gemma, Rhani.</p>
<p>Goals. Rhani 2, Jasmine, Cassie, Tara.</p>

<div id="r08" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 8</h3>
<p>We played one of the top teams today being East Ringwood at our home ground today. We knew it was going to be a tough game and with 7 players out, our numbers were a little down.<br aria-hidden="true" />We played with 16 a side which gave us no bench.<br aria-hidden="true" />Our attitude before the game was pretty good so it would just come down to our effort as to how we would go.<br aria-hidden="true" />We started pretty well and the effort was definitely there but it needed to be better to keep up with the opposition. Where we fell down in some little areas, East Ringwood capitalised and kicked goals.<br aria-hidden="true" />The second and third quarter were pretty much the same and although we were competing, they were kicking away.<br aria-hidden="true" />In the last quarter, we turned things around and had a good crack at it. They played very well in the last and out scored the other team but we still went down 84-34.<br aria-hidden="true" />Proud of how we finished the game.<br aria-hidden="true" />Goals- Taylah 2, Rhani 2, Tilli<br aria-hidden="true" />Best- Ami, Maddie, Hailey, Rhani, Emily, Mia, Matilda, Tilli</p>

<div id="r09" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 9</h3>
<p>Today we played Mooroolbark at their ground.<br aria-hidden="true" />Awesome day for footy. Nice and sunny and the ground was in great condition.<br aria-hidden="true" />Our pre match and warm up was really good today so I thought we were switched on to play.<br aria-hidden="true" />We started the game pretty well. It was a very evenly matched team we were playing against and it was just going to come down to which team did the little things better.<br aria-hidden="true" />The scores were very even at quarter time. In the second quarter I thought we had a bit more of the ball but we kicked 6 points to their 1 goal 1. Unfortunately we did capitalise when we had the ball.<br aria-hidden="true" />We had a terrible 3rd quarter and they were able kick away from us and get a good lead.<br aria-hidden="true" />We had a good last quarter and out scored them in the last but our 3rd hurt us too much and we were unable get enough goals to get the result we wanted.<br aria-hidden="true" />We lost 53-32.<br aria-hidden="true" />Goals. Cassie, Tara, Mia, Rhani.<br aria-hidden="true" />Best. Rhani, Cassie, Gemma, Matilda, Ami, Tara, Mia</p>

<div id="r10" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 10</h3>
<p>Today we played Heathmont at our home ground. Heathmont are on top of the ladder so we knew it was going to be a hard game today.</p>
<p>We really focused on playing accountable footy, talking to support teammates and being confident to go for the ball when it was ours to go for.</p>
<p>Both teams were struggling for numbers but we managed to get enough to play 16 on 16.</p>
<p>Every quarter was very similar today. We match Heathmont at times but they just wanted the ball more than us and they were willing to work harder for their team mates than us.</p>
<p>Our effort level was there but to get a better result, it needed to be at a higher level. I was really happy our effort level was consistent for the whole 4 quarters.</p>
<p>We ended up losing 61-7.</p>
<p>Goals. Shayla</p>
<p>Best. Gemma, Mia, Ami, Marley, Emily, Rhani, Cassie</p>

<div id="r11" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 11</h3>
<p>We played North Ringwood today that their ground.</p>
<p>Because it was school holidays, we were very low in numbers and only had 15 players.</p>
<p>Our main focus was to improve on some things like tackling, supporting teammates and have a stronger presence at the contest.</p>
<p>We started the game well and you could see it was a very even contest. We played very well in the first quarter and only had a couple of things we needed to improve on to really control the game.</p>
<p>As the game went on, the girls didn&rsquo;t drop their effort levels at all. We grabbed a narrow lead at 3 quarter time so it was all or nothing in the last. The ball went end to end in the last quarter with our team kicking another goal and our defence working well to stop them kicking any goals to get a good win.</p>
<p>22-13.</p>
<p>Goals. Tara, Cassie, Taylah.</p>
<p>Best. Maddie, Matilda, Hailey, Mia, Tara, Shayla, Ami</p>

<div id="r12" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 12</h3>
<p>We played against Knox today at their ground. This was a battle for the wooden spoon, bottom vs second bottom.</p>
<p>If was very confident if we played well today, we could get the win. Especially with our improvements from last week.</p>
<p>We started the game ok. Our effort levels were pretty good and we shared the ball around quite well. We had a lot more of the ball than the other team but we just couldn&rsquo;t get the score on the board. We let ourselves down a little when we didn&rsquo;t pick up our players when they had the ball.</p>
<p>Our second quarter wasn&rsquo;t great at all. Our effort levels weren&rsquo;t nearly where they needed to be and we didn&rsquo;t pick up our players enough resulting in Knox kicking a couple of goals to take the lead.</p>
<p>After a razz up at half time, our third quarter was much better. We had more of the ball than Knox and we got back in front.</p>
<p>For the most of the last quarter, we had the ball in forward line but instead of kicking goals, we kicked 6 points. In the last 5 minutes, Knox kicked 2 quick goals and we were only up by 1 point.</p>
<p>We held them off for the last 2 minutes to win by 1 point. 32-31</p>
<p>Goals. Rhani 3, Shayla</p>
<p>Best. Mia, Rhani, Tara, Jas, Ami, Maddie, Gemma &nbsp;</p>

<div id="r13" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 13</h3>
<p>Today we played Wantirna South at our ground.</p>
<p>It was a terrible day for footy and we even had to start the game late due to the thunder and lightning.</p>
<p>We did have a really good warm up and although we were playing against 1 of the top sides, I thought we would have a good crack today.</p>
<p>The conditions were tough but we started really well. We stayed with them for the whole first quarter so I was really happy with the standard we were setting.</p>
<p>The second quarter was much the same but the opposition were able to kick a late goal giving them the lead at half time.</p>
<p>We stepped up in the third quarter. Our pressure was really good and we were able to hit the front at 3 quarter time. We battled hard in the last quarter but a couple of our players got injured and the girls were running out of energy. The opposition had more of the ball in the last quarter, resulting in them kicking goals and winning the game.</p>
<p>It was a really good effort by our girls.</p>
<p>Goal- Tilli, Tara</p>
<p>Best- Mia, Maddie, Rhani, Jas, Tara, Hailey</p>

<div id="r14" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Round 14</h3>
<p>We played Ferntree Gully/ Norwood at our home ground today.<br aria-hidden="true" />We were very keen to have a good last game of the season. We had a pretty relaxed, enjoyable warm up and the girls seemed ready to have a fun game.<br aria-hidden="true" />We started off not too bad but very quickly you could see the other teams effort was a bit better than ours resulting in them winning more of the ball. We were competitive but the other team had a little more polish in what they were doing enabling them to kick more goals.<br aria-hidden="true" />The second quarter was much the same so we headed in at half time with a bit of work to do to try and cut down their lead.<br aria-hidden="true" />To the girls credit, they really stepped up in the second half. We had a few frustrating umpire decisions but the girls just kept battling away and kept their heads up.<br aria-hidden="true" />The second half was very even and I was very happy with the way we finished the game.<br aria-hidden="true" />Goals. Ruby 2, Tilli.<br aria-hidden="true" />Best. Hailey, Rhani, Mia, Maddie, Gemma, Ruby, Skye, Tara.</p>

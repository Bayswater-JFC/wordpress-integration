  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>First game for the year against East Ringwood at their ground.</p>
<p>We had a few girls play their first game for the club and a few play the first ever game.</p>
<p>It was a great day for footy but I also new East Ringwood were a strong side.</p>
<p>The effort from our girls from start to finish was really good. Unfortunately , East Ringwood were better structured and used the ball better than us resulting in them controlling more of the game.</p>
<p>We had a few good passages of play resulting in goals but fell short in the end.</p>
<p>This was a good experience for the girls and showed us where we need to improve and where the girls need to position themselves on the field.</p>
<p>We lost 56-21.</p>
<p>Goals. Gemma, Mia, Taylah</p>
<p>Best. Mia, Maddie, Taylah, Shayla, Ami</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>Looking to bounce back from round 1, today we played Endeavour Hills/Rowille at home.</p>
<p>The girls were switched on started the game well. They shared the ball around to create scoring opportunities, unfortunately our kicking accuracy was a bit off and we kicked a lot of points.</p>
<p>Our talking was much better this week and they played well for the whole 4 quarters.</p>
<p>Although we won very easily and already seeing improvements, we know what we need to keep working on to keep improving.</p>
<p>Great Anzac Day Sportsmanship.</p>
<p>We won 113-0.</p>
<p>Goals. Rhani 4, Cassie 2, Maddie 2, Gemma 2, Skye, Tianah, Jasmine, Matilda, Tilli</p>
<p>Best. Rhani, Mia, Hailey, Maddie, Gemma, Ami, Tilli, Taylah, Matilda, Jasmine.</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
<p>Today we played Heathmont at their ground.</p>
<p>After training so well on Thursday night and knowing Heathmont is a strong side, I was really looking forward to the challenge today.</p>
<p>Our warm up was pretty good, it was just going to come down to which team wanted it more on the day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Heathmont started well and we didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Our forwards didn&rsquo;t position themselves well and clearly Heathmont wanted the ball and attacked the ball harder than than us resulting in our girls chasing them around the park.</p>
<p>I spoke at quarter time at what we needed to work on but we were unable to produce the goods we needed to turn things around.</p>
<p>We were trying, but just not hard enough or smart enough to change the momentum of the game.</p>
<p>Credit to the girls in the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;quarter. They played heaps better, presented well and we won that quarter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Heathmont controlled the last quarter and went on to win the game 69-21.</p>
<p>As a team, we really need to have a look at ourselves and look at ways to improve how we play. If we knuckle down and work a bit harder, I reckon we could see a lot of improvement, very quickly.</p>
<p>Hopefully we step up and bounce back next week.</p>
<p>cheers</p>

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>Today we played Boronia at their ground.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately we are a little low on numbers and with a couple of girls unable to play so we only had 11 to take the field.</p>
  <p>Boronia sent a few players over to even up the numbers.</p>
  <p>
    We had a really good first quarter. Our effort level was high, our talk was good and we made a lot of effort to get in all the right spots to give us the
    best opportunity to drive the ball forward. We took a good lead at quarter time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second quarter was much more even. The effort level was still really good but we just weren&rsquo;t picking up their players enough so something we
    would work on in the third quarter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately we lost 2 players at half time so we had to play 2 players short which was just too hard. They were still trying very hard but with 2 extra
    players on the field, Boronia were able to kick goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last quarter got even worse for our numbers with another player unable to play so now we were 3 players short for the last quarter. Boronia came home
    strong and it just hurt us too much having 3 less players on the field.
  </p>
  <p>We ended up losing 62-38. The girls didn&rsquo;t stop trying, which was very pleasing.</p>
  <p>Goals. Liv Haun 2, Haylee 2, Ella 2<br />Best. Mathilda, Liv Haun, Ella, Marley, Milly, Saanvi</p>

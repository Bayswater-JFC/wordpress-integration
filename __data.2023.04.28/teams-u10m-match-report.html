  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>Wet and soggy conditions greeted us for our round 2 match versus Blackburn. Our captains for the game were our first year players, Keagan and Pep, who led their team out for the game and tossed the car key (we were missing a coin at the time).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a tough game as Blackburn were a strong team but we bravely fought through the wintery conditions, some kids frozen to the spot. The game was played with a lot of pressure in the contest with the slippery ball making it hard to get clean possession. Hamish led the way with lots of running and getting plenty of the ball. As the game wore on, we noticed an improvement in tackling with Heath and Dallas getting rewarded for their efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a team we need to work on some of the basics like running to make an option to receive the ball as well as disposing of the ball before giving a chance for the opposition to tackle us. In under 8&rsquo;s and 9&rsquo;s we may have been able to run around opposition with ease, now we have to pick our moments to get a big kick towards our goals or risk getting a holding the ball decision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My message to the kids after the game was that we have to take the good with the bad. It was a tough game, tough conditions and umpire decisions on tackling made it hard as well, but this is the ups and downs of sport and we pick ourselves up and go again. I was proud of their efforts and we look forward to coming together again at training on Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go Kangas!&nbsp;</p>

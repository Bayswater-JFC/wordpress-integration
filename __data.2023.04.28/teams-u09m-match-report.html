  <h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>Great games today to all the boys.</p>
<p>On a glorious Sunday morning in down town Croydon, the boys were pumped and ready to play.</p>
<p>Our defense was strong, following the basics of getting in front, arms up and applying pressure.</p>
<p>The midfield was amazing at getting the ball and boosting it to the forwards.</p>
<p>The forwards really had some fun kicking a few 'sausage rolls' and getting around each other to celebrate.</p>
<p>To think where the skills have accelerated from this time last year to now is absolutely amazing. The coaching team could not be prouder.</p>
<p>Thankyou to all who came down to watch, help out and support the mighty Baysy Under 9 family.</p>
<p>See you all Friday night ðŸ’šðŸ’›ðŸ’šðŸ’›</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>On Sunday 16/4 Batswater u9's took on Wantirna.<br>The team were very brave as the rain pelted down and we all go soaked! LOL. Thankfully the wind was calm and it was not too cold.<br>We have worked on calling out for the ball at training and passing to a player in a better position. It was on display Sunday as the team looked for options and got into space.<br>The rain did not dampen the spirits of our under 9's as they played a great game.<br>Well done team.<br>Regards<br>Mark, Chris&nbsp;</p>

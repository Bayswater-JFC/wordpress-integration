  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    The season started off with an exciting time for Mateo, who played his 50th game for the club. North Ringwood got off to a fast start, kicking 5 goals in
    the first quarter.
  </p>
  <p>After regrouping at the first break, we identified that our pressure wasn't at the level that it needed to be.</p>
  <p>Led by the midfield, the team lifted and as such limited North Ringwood's scoring for the remainder of the game, while we kicked a few goals ourselves.</p>
  <p>
    As was seen in Sunday's game, we have set a standard, which moving forward we need to bring week in week out. If we can continue to 'bring the heat' we will
    have an enjoyable season.

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    Prior to the game, I explained to the boys that the game wasn't going to be pretty given the weather conditions. I asked them to bring effort and get their
    hands dirty. We started the game off really well with all players contributing, putting their head down and getting to work. As the game went on, we tried
    our very best but were unfortunately out played against a better outfit on the day. With players coming back, I expect us to get better, and if we continue
    to get to training and work hard a win will be around the corner. Special mentions to Xavier who run hard all day, providing us with lots of spark and
    hardness around the packs, Jordan and Zakiya in the ruck, Axel at full back and to our two new players Angus and Shevinn who looked at home on the footy
    field. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    It was a memorable occasion for the team to be a part of such a special game. Prior to the game we were able to pay our respects to the men and women that
    served and currently serve for Australia and New Zealand. At the conclusion of the last post, it was game time. Unfortunately, Lysterfield got the jump on
    us early. They were first to the ball which allowed them to play the game on their terms. &nbsp;As the game continued on, the boys didn't provide enough
    pressure to slow Lysterfield from scoring, allowing them to control the game. At three quarter time, I explained to the boys that we needed to apply more
    pressure and work harder for one another. To be teams credit, we got work and ran the game out, kicking three goals to one in the final term to earn some
    respect back. Next game Vs Vermont will be a tough game as they are each week. We need to bring the heat from the start and work harder for each other.
    Finally, a big congratulations to Tommy Walker for being awarded the Anzac Day medal for the Bayswater JFC.&nbsp;

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>
    On Monday night during the players match review, the team identified that we had been playing some inconsistent football throughout the first three rounds.
    As such and to the team's credit we went to work on what we thought we needed to improve, prior to taking on an undefeated Vermont. &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    It was always going to be a really good test for us, taking on a team that has been a clear stand out thus far in the early part of the season. I explained
    to the players prior to the game that we would be trying some things during the game. This included many of the boys playing in positions that they hadn't
    ever played before. While we were made to work hard by Vermont, I was really proud as to how hard we worked over the four quarters.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Irrespective of what the scoreboard displayed at the end of the game, the boys walked off with their heads held high, with each of them knowing they did
    everything they could to help their mate out all game.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the game, we got to see the many of the boys do things which they hadn't done in the previous three games. One example of this was Marley providing a
    great shepherd which set up Tommy who went on to kick a great goal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the grading games have concluded, we get to reset as a team. We have set a standard of football of which we need to bring every week. If we do that a
    win will only be around the corner.

  <h3>Round 5</h3>
  <p>
    After a great week on the training track, which saw four senior players take training on Wednesday, we took on the top of the table Boronia in Tyler
    Willoughby&rsquo;s 50th game. The weather from the outset wasn&rsquo;t the kindest to us, however we powered on.
  </p>
  <p>
    The players worked extremely hard for each other yet again, laying some hard tackles, whilst never giving up on the task at hand. During the game the
    coaches made some positional moves which gave some opportunities for many of the players who don&rsquo;t often play in these positions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although we didn&rsquo;t get the points on the day, we were again able to walk off the ground with our heads held high. Next week we play Lysterfield who we
    only played a few weeks ago. We know that if we play four quarters against them that we have a big chance of walking away with the points.
  </p>
</div>
<div id="r06" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 6</h3>
  <p>
    The weather was sparkling and the boys were ready to redeem themselves from a handful of weeks ago when Lysterfield beat us convincingly on our home ground
    in the Anzac Day clash. During the first quarter we worked really hard for each other, doing the one percenters and running hard both offensively and
    defensively. &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    As the game went on, we weren&rsquo;t able to match the opposition on the scoreboard, but we certainly made them work for their goals, while we kicked a few
    ourselves. This included a couple great goals by Gus who keeps impressing up forward. Although we lost on the day, we continue to build and work hard for
    each other. &nbsp;If we continue to do this, playing for each other, and linking up around the ground, I have no doubt a win is only around the corner. A
    special mention to Taj and Koby who both came into the game very unwell, but put on their boots as they didn&rsquo;t want to let their teammates and club
    down.
  </p>

<div id="r07" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 7</h3>
  <p>Vs Wantirna South.</p>
  <p>
    We arrived at the ground full of confidence after playing well over the past few weeks. We knew that if we played a four-quarter game, and worked hard for
    each other, that we would walk away as winners on the day. Once the ball was thrown up, we got plenty of the ball, moving it forward constantly, however we
    weren&rsquo;t making it count in the goals column, kicking to many points. &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    As the game went on, the boys kept working really well together, linking up around the ground and laying plenty of tackles. At &frac34; time, we were down
    by two goals however had a lot more to give. The coaches made a few changes which opened the play up and before we knew it, Gus kicked the first goal of the
    final quarter. With only a few minutes to go and down by a couple points, the ball landed in Ryan&rsquo;s hands who made no mistake, kicking the winning
    goal for the team, giving us our first win for the season.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we have been able to enjoy our first win for the season, moving forward I hope that it gives the team belief in knowing that we can win from any
    position as we did against Wantirna South. &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Well done and keep working hard for each other.</p>

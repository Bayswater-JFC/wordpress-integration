  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>Today we played Boronia at their ground.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately we are a little low on numbers and with a couple of girls unable to play so we only had 11 to take the field.</p>
  <p>Boronia sent a few players over to even up the numbers.</p>
  <p>
    We had a really good first quarter. Our effort level was high, our talk was good and we made a lot of effort to get in all the right spots to give us the
    best opportunity to drive the ball forward. We took a good lead at quarter time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second quarter was much more even. The effort level was still really good but we just weren&rsquo;t picking up their players enough so something we
    would work on in the third quarter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately we lost 2 players at half time so we had to play 2 players short which was just too hard. They were still trying very hard but with 2 extra
    players on the field, Boronia were able to kick goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last quarter got even worse for our numbers with another player unable to play so now we were 3 players short for the last quarter. Boronia came home
    strong and it just hurt us too much having 3 less players on the field.
  </p>
  <p>We ended up losing 62-38. The girls didn&rsquo;t stop trying, which was very pleasing.</p>
  <p>Goals. Liv Haun 2, Haylee 2, Ella 2<br />Best. Mathilda, Liv Haun, Ella, Marley, Milly, Saanvi</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    Today we played North Ringwood at their ground. Exciting day to play showing our respect to the Anzacs. With no change rooms to use, the warm and match prep
    was a little different but all the girls had turned up with a great attitude and with a few new girls playing their first game, we had enough numbers to
    play a full side.
  </p>
  <p>We started the game really well. The intensity was good and we had more of the ball so looked to be in control early on.</p>
  <p>
    This stayed the same for most of the game. If we had kicked straighter, we would have extended our lead a lot more. There were some moments in the game when
    we were too loose and not picking up our players enough but we tightened up at the right times and the leaders stood up to turn this around.
  </p>
  <p>Overall, a good win for the girls.</p>
  <p>Matilda was awarded the Anzac medal by the other team.</p>
  <p>We won 41-8. We kicked 5-11 so goal kicking practice for us this week.</p>
  <p>Goals. Matilda 2, Marley, Saanvi, Liv Haun</p>
  <p>Best. Marley, Haylee, Milly, Matilda, Shayla, Gemma, Ella, Liv Haun</p>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>Today we played SBL Tigers and we knew it would be a tough game looking at their previous results and where they were on the ladder.</p>
  <p>The girls seemed quite focused to play well leading up to the start of the game.</p>
  <p>
    As we expected, it was of high standard and the girls very quickly adjusted and started the game very well. The girls were working very hard all over the
    ground which made the game very close. In the second quarter we didn&rsquo;t slow down at all which was fantastic.
  </p>
  <p>They were playing very well and you could see they were enjoying the result of working hard.</p>
  <p>
    We went in at half time in front so our focus in the third quarter was to continue what we had started. We had another really good quarter and extended our
    lead to 2 goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the last quarter, you could see we were getting tired having no bench to rotate and the other team having a full bench. 2 of our players got injured and
    had to come off and we ended up just falling short of the win by 2 points.
  </p>
  <p>Our best game so far this year.</p>
  <p>We lost 28-26</p>
  <p>Goals. Shaylee 3, Liv Halse</p>
  <p>Best. Haylee, Marley, Matilda, Liv, Liv, Saanvi, Tiarnah, Chloe</p>

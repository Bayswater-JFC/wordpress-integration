  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    The season started off with an exciting time for Mateo, who played his 50th game for the club. North Ringwood got off to a fast start, kicking 5 goals in
    the first quarter.
  </p>
  <p>After regrouping at the first break, we identified that our pressure wasn't at the level that it needed to be.</p>
  <p>Led by the midfield, the team lifted and as such limited North Ringwood's scoring for the remainder of the game, while we kicked a few goals ourselves.</p>
  <p>
    As was seen in Sunday's game, we have set a standard, which moving forward we need to bring week in week out. If we can continue to 'bring the heat' we will
    have an enjoyable season.

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    Prior to the game, I explained to the boys that the game wasn't going to be pretty given the weather conditions. I asked them to bring effort and get their
    hands dirty. We started the game off really well with all players contributing, putting their head down and getting to work. As the game went on, we tried
    our very best but were unfortunately out played against a better outfit on the day. With players coming back, I expect us to get better, and if we continue
    to get to training and work hard a win will be around the corner. Special mentions to Xavier who run hard all day, providing us with lots of spark and
    hardness around the packs, Jordan and Zakiya in the ruck, Axel at full back and to our two new players Angus and Shevinn who looked at home on the footy
    field. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    It was a memorable occasion for the team to be a part of such a special game. Prior to the game we were able to pay our respects to the men and women that
    served and currently serve for Australia and New Zealand. At the conclusion of the last post, it was game time. Unfortunately, Lysterfield got the jump on
    us early. They were first to the ball which allowed them to play the game on their terms. &nbsp;As the game continued on, the boys didn't provide enough
    pressure to slow Lysterfield from scoring, allowing them to control the game. At three quarter time, I explained to the boys that we needed to apply more
    pressure and work harder for one another. To be teams credit, we got work and ran the game out, kicking three goals to one in the final term to earn some
    respect back. Next game Vs Vermont will be a tough game as they are each week. We need to bring the heat from the start and work harder for each other.
    Finally, a big congratulations to Tommy Walker for being awarded the Anzac Day medal for the Bayswater JFC.&nbsp;

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>
    On Monday night during the players match review, the team identified that we had been playing some inconsistent football throughout the first three rounds.
    As such and to the team's credit we went to work on what we thought we needed to improve, prior to taking on an undefeated Vermont. &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    It was always going to be a really good test for us, taking on a team that has been a clear stand out thus far in the early part of the season. I explained
    to the players prior to the game that we would be trying some things during the game. This included many of the boys playing in positions that they hadn't
    ever played before. While we were made to work hard by Vermont, I was really proud as to how hard we worked over the four quarters.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Irrespective of what the scoreboard displayed at the end of the game, the boys walked off with their heads held high, with each of them knowing they did
    everything they could to help their mate out all game.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the game, we got to see the many of the boys do things which they hadn't done in the previous three games. One example of this was Marley providing a
    great shepherd which set up Tommy who went on to kick a great goal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the grading games have concluded, we get to reset as a team. We have set a standard of football of which we need to bring every week. If we do that a
    win will only be around the corner.

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>Dear Parents and Supporters,</p>
  <p>
    Bayswater Junior Football Team Under 8s kicked off their first game of the season with an impressive display of teamwork, determination and skill. It was
    great to see all the players enjoying their footy and giving their all on the field. The game took place at Lewis Park, and our young Bayswater team played
    against Noble Park who all played in great spirits.
  </p>
  <p>
    The team with Dan had a great start to the game, with Frankie and Hattie linking up well and moving the ball forward. Despite Alyan returning for his first
    training session just last week, he took to the field seamlessly and found plenty of the ball. There were plenty of great moments from all the players which
    had their parents sharing plenty of laughs and cheers throughout the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    Scott's players also had a cracking first game out, he was impressed with the great sportsmanship shown and delighted to see all the players having fun.
    Jack got the crowd cheering with the first goal of the year and Lewis showed great awareness with 3 awesome smothers. Was great to see the team work to get
    Logan involved passing the ball around to ensure everyone got a kick.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was fantastic to see the team handballing and bringing their teammates into the game across both fields. As a team, we are continuing to develop our
    fundamental skills and our defence, it is clear that our players are taking on board the feedback from their coaches and implementing it on the field.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, it was an excellent team effort, and we are proud of the progress our players are making in both their individual skills and team play. We are
    excited to see how they continue to develop throughout the season.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you also to our trainer James and our team managers Tim and Clare for preparing us well for the first game and to all parents and supporters who came
    out to cheer on the team. Your continued support is greatly appreciated, and we look forward to seeing you all at our next game.
  </p>
  <p>Kind regards,<br />Dan and Scott</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    Well... it was wet wet wet on Sunday!<br />Big thanks to all the parents for getting their kids up and going in the middle of school holidays when the
    weather was cold, dark and wet.
  </p>
  <p>Despite the cold and wet start, everyone was enthusiastic and excited to play.</p>
  <p>
    Game 1<br />Started well with some good work in the middle of the ground by Jett and Madden working well in tandem to get the ball forward.&nbsp;<br />Harvey
    was dynamic in the forward line scoring his first goal for the season, also working well with Alyan to score goals as well.<br />In the last quarter Frankie
    and Cohen were excellent in defence, rebounding through Flynn in particular through the middle to get it into the forward line.
  </p>
  <p>
    Game 2<br />Patrick, Hattie and Pheonix were enormous all day with their continual effort around the ground and their will to be involved in the contest.
    Xavier was good up forward even managing to high 5 an Endevour Hills player after kicking a goal.<br />Max gave an exceptional effort in the 2nd half after
    some first half doubts.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />Highlights for the team were moving the ball well, great talk and using each other really well to move the ball forward. Awesome team effort despite
    the conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both games were competed in tremendous spirit given the conditions and every Baswater player was very excited to play for the opposition given we had 17 and
    they had 9 across the 2 fields.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Great game by all</p>
  <p>Bring on next week!</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    Bayswater JFC Under 8&rsquo;s took the field on Round 3 against the Basin Bears, in what was a special day for both teams to commemorate Anzac Day. The game
    was played in great spirits by all involved, and it was an honour for our players to mark such an important occasion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout the game, both teams displayed tremendous sportsmanship, and our players should be proud of their efforts. Harvey was instrumental in sharing the
    ball around and played a great team game, while Alyan took some excellent contested marks and showed great composure under pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Phoenix demonstrated amazing pace, with few able to keep up with her on several occasions, as she made some exciting runs towards goal. Our team's
    commitment to teamwork and communication paid dividends, as we worked hard to support each other both defensively and offensively.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Basin Coach's awarded Anzac Medals to Declan and Randall for their outstanding performances on the day, and we congratulate them both for their efforts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, it was another positive performance from our team, and we are excited about the progress that we continue to make as a group. We look forward to
    taking the field next week and continuing to build on the teamwork and individual skills that we have been working hard to develop.

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>
    Bayswater JFC under 8's took on the Ferntree Gully Eagles in Round 4 on a frosty Saturday morning. The team was in great spirits, following a number taking
    part in mini match during the half time break of the Bayswater Seniors game the day before.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;Despite the chilly start to the day, the weather turned out to be perfect for footy. The team displayed excellent teamwork and showed no signs of
    slowing down. Phoenix continued to impress with her relentless running, while Hudson used his height to his advantage, knocking the ball towards goal out of
    the middle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Johnny's never-say-die attitude was reminiscent of the Collingwood side's fightback late in the game. Meanwhile, Hattie had a great game, finding the ball
    with some excited cheering from her siblings on the sideline.
  </p>
  <p>Logan was hard at it all day, attacking the contested balls fearlessly. Xavier had a standout performance, dominating up and down the field.</p>
  <p>
    Overall, it was another great display of teamwork from the Bayswater U8's, building on their progress from the previous week. The team is looking forward to
    building on this performance in the next round.

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p dir="ltr">
    Round one set the tone with the team playing in great spirits despite the challenging wet conditions. In my absence, Scott and Andrew ensured a smooth start
    leading the team out. The highlight of the game was witnessing our new players take the field for the first time, seamlessly integrating into the team
    dynamics. Despite the slippery conditions, teamwork prevailed, with every player contributing their best.
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr">
    Some great highlights for round 1 including Phoenix, whose combination of pressure and skill stood out, while Frankie's ability to involve everyone in the
    game was commendable. Lennox had a positive start getting involved in the game, and Billy's attack on the ball was excellent. Declan cleared the ball out of
    the centre well, provided numerous scoring opportunities, complemented by Jack's finishing with two cracking goals.

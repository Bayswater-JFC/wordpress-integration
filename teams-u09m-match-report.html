  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p dir="ltr">
    Round one set the tone with the team playing in great spirits despite the challenging wet conditions. In my absence, Scott and Andrew ensured a smooth start
    leading the team out. The highlight of the game was witnessing our new players take the field for the first time, seamlessly integrating into the team
    dynamics. Despite the slippery conditions, teamwork prevailed, with every player contributing their best.
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr">
    Some great highlights for round 1 including Phoenix, whose combination of pressure and skill stood out, while Frankie's ability to involve everyone in the
    game was commendable. Lennox had a positive start getting involved in the game, and Billy's attack on the ball was excellent. Declan cleared the ball out of
    the centre well, provided numerous scoring opportunities, complemented by Jack's finishing with two cracking goals.
  </p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    Round two saw the team emphasising running the ball forward with intent and in numbers. The response was immediate, as players displayed relentless
    determination, pushing hard to gain ground. Logan executed instructions impeccably, consistently finding teammates with handballs out the back of play.
    Lewis showcased his tenacity, driving the ball forward while seeking out targets up field.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bella's standout mark in the backline demonstrated defensive awareness, while Harvey's debut was marked by sheer determination and skillful ball movement.
    Cohen's spectacular mark and Patrick's jubilant celebration after a stunning goal had everyone cheering with excitement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking ahead, the team is determined to build on their existing skills and game sense from the previous season. Focus will also be placed on tightening
    defensive structures, particularly manning the mark, and exploring opportunities to switch the ball across the ground to create scoring chances.
  </p>
  <p>The team has kicked off the season with a bang, now having two games under their belt, showcasing promising signs for the journey ahead.</p>
  <p>We are all looking forward to the coming weeks, see you all on the track Friday night for another fun training session.</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>Under perfect playing conditions, our under 9's mixed team gathered for their second home game of the season, facing off against Lysterfield.</p>
  <p>
    Continuing our focus from previous weeks, the team maintained a strong emphasis on running the ball forward and creating opportunities out the back of the
    contest. This week, we introduced switching the ball, and it was fantastic to witness the team embracing this new strategy with enthusiasm and the
    confidence to give it go.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite a few minor issues encountered during the game, rest assured that these were addressed promptly after the match, with umpires and Lysterfield's
    coaches receiving our feedback positively. Our commitment remains unwavering in ensuring a safe and enjoyable environment for all our players.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candice and Lennex showcased their growing confidence as they settled into the team, actively participating in the contest, and contributing to the team's
    efforts. Meanwhile, Jett and Declan demonstrated excellent defensive skills, intercepting potential goals with goal line stoppages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Randall and Frankie exhibited great teamwork, linking up with precision handballs and demonstrating relentless effort with their hard running. Max and Jack
    led the charge in experimenting with the switch across the ground, setting a promising precedent for future matches.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the adjacent field with Scott, Billy and Logan dominated the midfield with their outstanding intensity, while Phoenix and Harvey also had a crack at
    switching the ball, which was exciting to see and will be something we continue to try in the round ahead. Cohen and Patrick's spectacular goals, along with
    Johnny's fearless attack on the ball, added to the excitement of the weekend's matches.
  </p>
  <p>
    We did miss Bella, who unfortunately has sustained a fracture and will be out of action for a few weeks. We have heard she may be down at training this week
    to get some autographs on her plaster, which we would love to see. Take care Bella, we all wish you a speedy recovery.
  </p>
  <p>
    A huge thanks to all our team officials and parent helpers this week! Special mention to Scott for going above and beyond taking extra time out during the
    week to measure and mark out our grounds to the recommended length. The players loved the extended field, which facilitated better ball movement and
    involvement. Thanks, Scott, for your dedication!
  </p>
  <p>Look forward to seeing everyone back on track this Friday.</p>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>
    This morning, our team gathered at Wally Tew Reserve for our Anzac Day match against Ferntree Gully. It was a privilege to come together as a team,
    honouring the brave individuals who have served and sacrificed for our country.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a deep sense of respect for the day's significance, our players competed with remarkable determination and sportsmanship against a strong Ferntree
    Gully side. Despite the challenge, our team showcased their skill and class across both fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    Under Andrew and Scott's guidance, our players put on dominant performance. Despite starting with a few players short on Dan's field, the contest was
    fiercely fought, with Jett's timely arrival providing a much-needed boost to our defence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Several players stood out with their exceptional efforts on the field. Logan demonstrated tremendous determination and effort throughout the match, while
    Patrick and Max elevated their game as the match progressed. Billy and Randall formed a dynamic partnership, linking up effectively and showcasing strong
    running throughout the game. Xavier was instrumental out of the centre and great to see Harvey having an impact moving the ball quickly by hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both teams were given the privilege and responsibility to recognise players from the opposing side with Anzac Day Medals, for the players in the match
    considered to best exemplify the Anzac spirit&mdash;skill, courage, self-sacrifice, teamwork and fair play.
  </p>
  <p>
    Frankie's outstanding teamwork and relentless pressure earned him the Anzac Day Medal, a testament to his invaluable contributions to the team. Lennox's
    display of bravery was also recognised by the Ferntree Gully coach with an Anzac Day Medal. Despite sustaining a nasty head knock while defending against
    two opponents, Lennox exhibited resilience by returning to the field after taking a moment to recover. Her courage in defence and resilience were truly
    inspiring.
  </p>
  <p>
    We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all our team officials and parent helpers for their unwavering support and dedication. Today's match exemplified the
    exceptional teamwork and camaraderie within our team.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we reflect on today's game, we eagerly anticipate coming together tonight for our first round-up of the year. It presents a wonderful opportunity to
    celebrate and acknowledge all our players for their efforts and improvements throughout the season so far.

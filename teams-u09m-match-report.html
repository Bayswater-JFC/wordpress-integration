  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p dir="ltr">
    Round one set the tone with the team playing in great spirits despite the challenging wet conditions. In my absence, Scott and Andrew ensured a smooth start
    leading the team out. The highlight of the game was witnessing our new players take the field for the first time, seamlessly integrating into the team
    dynamics. Despite the slippery conditions, teamwork prevailed, with every player contributing their best.
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr">
    Some great highlights for round 1 including Phoenix, whose combination of pressure and skill stood out, while Frankie's ability to involve everyone in the
    game was commendable. Lennox had a positive start getting involved in the game, and Billy's attack on the ball was excellent. Declan cleared the ball out of
    the centre well, provided numerous scoring opportunities, complemented by Jack's finishing with two cracking goals.
  </p>
</div>
<div id="r02" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    Round two saw the team emphasising running the ball forward with intent and in numbers. The response was immediate, as players displayed relentless
    determination, pushing hard to gain ground. Logan executed instructions impeccably, consistently finding teammates with handballs out the back of play.
    Lewis showcased his tenacity, driving the ball forward while seeking out targets up field.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bella's standout mark in the backline demonstrated defensive awareness, while Harvey's debut was marked by sheer determination and skillful ball movement.
    Cohen's spectacular mark and Patrick's jubilant celebration after a stunning goal had everyone cheering with excitement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking ahead, the team is determined to build on their existing skills and game sense from the previous season. Focus will also be placed on tightening
    defensive structures, particularly manning the mark, and exploring opportunities to switch the ball across the ground to create scoring chances.
  </p>
  <p>The team has kicked off the season with a bang, now having two games under their belt, showcasing promising signs for the journey ahead.</p>
  <p>We are all looking forward to the coming weeks, see you all on the track Friday night for another fun training session.</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>Under perfect playing conditions, our under 9's mixed team gathered for their second home game of the season, facing off against Lysterfield.</p>
  <p>
    Continuing our focus from previous weeks, the team maintained a strong emphasis on running the ball forward and creating opportunities out the back of the
    contest. This week, we introduced switching the ball, and it was fantastic to witness the team embracing this new strategy with enthusiasm and the
    confidence to give it go.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite a few minor issues encountered during the game, rest assured that these were addressed promptly after the match, with umpires and Lysterfield's
    coaches receiving our feedback positively. Our commitment remains unwavering in ensuring a safe and enjoyable environment for all our players.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candice and Lennex showcased their growing confidence as they settled into the team, actively participating in the contest, and contributing to the team's
    efforts. Meanwhile, Jett and Declan demonstrated excellent defensive skills, intercepting potential goals with goal line stoppages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Randall and Frankie exhibited great teamwork, linking up with precision handballs and demonstrating relentless effort with their hard running. Max and Jack
    led the charge in experimenting with the switch across the ground, setting a promising precedent for future matches.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the adjacent field with Scott, Billy and Logan dominated the midfield with their outstanding intensity, while Phoenix and Harvey also had a crack at
    switching the ball, which was exciting to see and will be something we continue to try in the round ahead. Cohen and Patrick's spectacular goals, along with
    Johnny's fearless attack on the ball, added to the excitement of the weekend's matches.
  </p>
  <p>
    We did miss Bella, who unfortunately has sustained a fracture and will be out of action for a few weeks. We have heard she may be down at training this week
    to get some autographs on her plaster, which we would love to see. Take care Bella, we all wish you a speedy recovery.
  </p>
  <p>
    A huge thanks to all our team officials and parent helpers this week! Special mention to Scott for going above and beyond taking extra time out during the
    week to measure and mark out our grounds to the recommended length. The players loved the extended field, which facilitated better ball movement and
    involvement. Thanks, Scott, for your dedication!
  </p>
  <p>Look forward to seeing everyone back on track this Friday.</p>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>
    This morning, our team gathered at Wally Tew Reserve for our Anzac Day match against Ferntree Gully. It was a privilege to come together as a team,
    honouring the brave individuals who have served and sacrificed for our country.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a deep sense of respect for the day's significance, our players competed with remarkable determination and sportsmanship against a strong Ferntree
    Gully side. Despite the challenge, our team showcased their skill and class across both fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    Under Andrew and Scott's guidance, our players put on dominant performance. Despite starting with a few players short on Dan's field, the contest was
    fiercely fought, with Jett's timely arrival providing a much-needed boost to our defence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Several players stood out with their exceptional efforts on the field. Logan demonstrated tremendous determination and effort throughout the match, while
    Patrick and Max elevated their game as the match progressed. Billy and Randall formed a dynamic partnership, linking up effectively and showcasing strong
    running throughout the game. Xavier was instrumental out of the centre and great to see Harvey having an impact moving the ball quickly by hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both teams were given the privilege and responsibility to recognise players from the opposing side with Anzac Day Medals, for the players in the match
    considered to best exemplify the Anzac spirit&mdash;skill, courage, self-sacrifice, teamwork and fair play.
  </p>
  <p>
    Frankie's outstanding teamwork and relentless pressure earned him the Anzac Day Medal, a testament to his invaluable contributions to the team. Lennox's
    display of bravery was also recognised by the Ferntree Gully coach with an Anzac Day Medal. Despite sustaining a nasty head knock while defending against
    two opponents, Lennox exhibited resilience by returning to the field after taking a moment to recover. Her courage in defence and resilience were truly
    inspiring.
  </p>
  <p>
    We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all our team officials and parent helpers for their unwavering support and dedication. Today's match exemplified the
    exceptional teamwork and camaraderie within our team.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we reflect on today's game, we eagerly anticipate coming together tonight for our first round-up of the year. It presents a wonderful opportunity to
    celebrate and acknowledge all our players for their efforts and improvements throughout the season so far.
  </p>

  <h3>Round 5</h3>
  <p>
    It was a cracking morning for footy as we welcomed Lysterfield again to our home ground. Was really nice to have our Baysie supporters cheer us on and to be
    able to welcome out the under 11&rsquo;s and cheer them on after our game too!
  </p>
  <p>
    Our team continues to show improvement week by week, and today was no exception. We witnessed some great passages of play, with each player contributing to
    the team effort.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cohen showcased his classiness by foot, hitting Harvey up field, who took a cracking mark and finished with a great goal, rewarding our efforts across the
    ground.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lewis's attack on the ball was nothing short of fantastic, a testament to the focus on this aspect during our training sessions. It was encouraging to see
    the team responding positively and growing in confidence to be first to the footy.
  </p>
  <p>We demonstrated effective ball movement by hand, with Patrick and Lennox leading the charge in running the ball well and releasing their teammates.</p>
  <p>
    Xavier and Frankie added to the excitement by letting the crowd know they were rather happy with their finishes for goal on multiple occasions, to the cheer
    of our supporters.
  </p>
  <p>
    A big thank you to all our team officials and parent helpers for their ongoing support and dedication. Your contributions make a significant difference to
    our team's enjoyment and success.

  <h3>Round 6</h3>
  <p>
    Our Kid's v Mothers Clash during Friday night footy training was great fun, and fortunately, all the kids survived despite some intense white line fever
    from the moms!&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Our mini match during the Bayswater Senior game was a great success. It was awesome to see all the kids take the field in the Baysie colors, proudly
    representing the club.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last two rounds have been packed with highlights. Xavier, Lewis, and Lennox pulled off some awesome marks. Phoenix and Billy continue to showcase their
    exceptional pace, consistently taking on the field with determination.
  </p>
  <p>Johnny, Max, Patrick, and Logan demonstrated fantastic resolve and effort which we will continue to encourage and recognise.</p>

  <h3>Round 7</h3>
  <p>
    We enjoyed our first club function of the year, with many parents joining us for the trivia night last Saturday. The hilarious costumes set the scene for a
    fun night and made for some great laughs.
  </p>
  <p>
    We were excited to welcome Archer and Cherish for their first game in Round 7. They slotted into the team seamlessly and are already making significant
    contributions. It's great to see new faces bringing fresh energy to the team.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the past few weeks, we've introduced a few new focus areas that you might have noticed during the games. We've been coaching the team on switching the
    ball and getting front and centre in marking contests. The kids are embracing these concepts enthusiastically, and we love seeing them apply these
    strategies on Sundays.
  </p>
  <p>
    These will continue as a theme over the coming weeks as well as ramping up our focus on fostering encouragement and celebration of their teammate&rsquo;s
    successes, at training and on Sundays. We are lucky to have such an awesome young team and we are committed to making their footy experience as fun and
    engaging as possible 😊
  </p>
  <p>Thank you to all our team officials and parent helpers for your ongoing support. Let's keep the momentum going and continue to build on our progress.</p>
  <p>See you all back on the track this Friday!</p>

  <h3>Round 8</h3>
  <p>
    This week, we bring you a special post-match interview with our goal-scoring champion Patrick and one of our Culture Champs, Johnny! Their insights will
    highlight the excitement of this round, but let's note a few key moments.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was a great taste of full-ground footy for our youngsters this morning against a strong Lysterfield outfit. This was our first chance to play as one full
    team, providing an excellent opportunity to showcase our ball movement. Max, Xavier, and Phoenix linked up well through the middle, while Declan and Frankie
    found great marking targets in Randall and Jack. Cohen had an absolute blinder today and should be proud of his hard work this season, which is truly
    showing on Sundays.
  </p>
  <p>
    I look forward to seeing you all tonight at our second Match Round-Up for the year, where I will share plenty of other great moments from today and the past
    four rounds!
  </p>
  <p>Cheers</p>

  <h3>Round 9</h3>
  <p>Today we faced a tough contest against Ringwood North, which provided an excellent opportunity for our team to build resilience and develop further.</p>
  <p>
    The challenging competition brought out some great team play. Cohen, Randall, and Phoenix linked up beautifully by handball, moving the ball quickly to
    score a goal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jett had one of his best games of the year, contesting the ball exceptionally well and hitting up targets with precision. Billy continued his impressive
    form with some great marking throughout the match. Patrick also stood out, attacking the ball fiercely and winning many contested possessions.
  </p>
  <p>It was fantastic to have Archer and Cherish back this week, both contributing well all day and showing their growing confidence and skill.</p>

  <h3>Round 11</h3>
  <p>
    Over the past few weeks, the team has continued to improve on looking for targets downfield and building on ball movement by hands out of the middle. We've
    also increased our focus on encouraging each other and celebrating the hard work and effort of our teammates.
  </p>
  <p>
    I&rsquo;ve been really impressed with the attack from Jett and Patrick, especially their outstanding second efforts over the past two games. Their
    determination and resilience have been commendable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Last week, we had the pleasure of welcoming Alex to the team. It was awesome to see him score his first goal this week! Randall has also been in cracking
    form, displaying excellent teamwork around the ground. His selflessness in passing in front of goal to share our success has been amazing.
  </p>
  <p>
    A big thanks to our post-match stars: Lewis, who snagged a tidy bag of goals yesterday; Candice, with some impressive ruck work; and Lennox, who really
    stepped up in the last quarter, making a big impact on the game. They should be proud of their contributions on the field over the past few rounds. It was
    also great to see Billy continue to show confidence in attacking the ball, and Harvey had one of his best games of the year.
  </p>
  <p>It was fantastic to celebrate our team&rsquo;s success at the round-up last night, great to see so many of the players and parents there!</p>
  <p>Congratulations to our players of the round Jett, Jack and Harvey and our Round Up Player T-Shirt awarded to Randall, Well done everyone!</p>

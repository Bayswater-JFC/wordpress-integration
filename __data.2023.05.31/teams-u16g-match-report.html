  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>Today we played Boronia at their ground.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately we are a little low on numbers and with a couple of girls unable to play so we only had 11 to take the field.</p>
  <p>Boronia sent a few players over to even up the numbers.</p>
  <p>
    We had a really good first quarter. Our effort level was high, our talk was good and we made a lot of effort to get in all the right spots to give us the
    best opportunity to drive the ball forward. We took a good lead at quarter time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second quarter was much more even. The effort level was still really good but we just weren&rsquo;t picking up their players enough so something we
    would work on in the third quarter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately we lost 2 players at half time so we had to play 2 players short which was just too hard. They were still trying very hard but with 2 extra
    players on the field, Boronia were able to kick goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last quarter got even worse for our numbers with another player unable to play so now we were 3 players short for the last quarter. Boronia came home
    strong and it just hurt us too much having 3 less players on the field.
  </p>
  <p>We ended up losing 62-38. The girls didn&rsquo;t stop trying, which was very pleasing.</p>
  <p>Goals. Liv Haun 2, Haylee 2, Ella 2<br />Best. Matilda, Liv Haun, Ella, Marley, Milly, Saanvi</p>

  <p>This round was a BYE</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    Today we played North Ringwood at their ground. Exciting day to play showing our respect to the Anzacs. With no change rooms to use, the warm and match prep
    was a little different but all the girls had turned up with a great attitude and with a few new girls playing their first game, we had enough numbers to
    play a full side.
  </p>
  <p>We started the game really well. The intensity was good and we had more of the ball so looked to be in control early on.</p>
  <p>
    This stayed the same for most of the game. If we had kicked straighter, we would have extended our lead a lot more. There were some moments in the game when
    we were too loose and not picking up our players enough but we tightened up at the right times and the leaders stood up to turn this around.
  </p>
  <p>Overall, a good win for the girls.</p>
  <p>Matilda was awarded the Anzac medal by the other team.</p>
  <p>We won 41-8. We kicked 5-11 so goal kicking practice for us this week.</p>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>Today we played SBL Tigers and we knew it would be a tough game looking at their previous results and where they were on the ladder.</p>
  <p>The girls seemed quite focused to play well leading up to the start of the game.</p>
  <p>
    As we expected, it was of high standard and the girls very quickly adjusted and started the game very well. The girls were working very hard all over the
    ground which made the game very close. In the second quarter we didn&rsquo;t slow down at all which was fantastic.
  </p>
  <p>They were playing very well and you could see they were enjoying the result of working hard.</p>
  <p>
    We went in at half time in front so our focus in the third quarter was to continue what we had started. We had another really good quarter and extended our
    lead to 2 goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the last quarter, you could see we were getting tired having no bench to rotate and the other team having a full bench. 2 of our players got injured and
    had to come off and we ended up just falling short of the win by 2 points.
  </p>
  <p>Our best game so far this year.</p>
  <p>We lost 28-26</p>
  <p>Goals. Shaylee 3, Liv Halse</p>

  <h3>Round 5</h3>
  <p class="x_MsoNormal">
    Today we played Boronia at their home ground. Unfortunately we had a few players out so we turned up with 13 players. Boronia gave us 2 players each quarter
    to even up.
  </p>
  <p class="x_MsoNormal">
    We started the game a bit slow. Although we were trying hard, we were too loose on our players and our attack on the ball was a little down than usual so
    for the first half , Boronia were able to control the play more than us.
  </p>
  <p class="x_MsoNormal">
    After having a chat at half time about what we needed to work on to improve, the second half was a different story. We were really good in the third
    quarter. Getting in the right positions and an vast improvement in our attack on the ball had us controlling the ball for most of the third quarter but we
    were unable to put the goals on the board. The last quarter was fairly even but playing 1 short in the last quarter made things pretty hard.
  </p>
  <p class="x_MsoNormal">I was very happy with our second half. We lost 50-12.</p>

  <h3>Round 6</h3>
  <p>
    Today was Mother&rsquo;s Day and we were playing Knox at their ground. It was a nice sunny day so ideal for footy and for the mums to watch their kids play
    footy.
  </p>
  <p>
    We spoke before the game about keeping our game plan simple but everyone jumping on board so we were all working for the same goals. Halyee was also playing
    her 50th game so we were keen to get a good result for her milestone game.
  </p>
  <p>
    We started off the game pretty well. We were getting the ball more than the other team and driving it forward. We had lots of scoring opportunities but
    unfortunately for us, we were kicking too many points. We really could&rsquo;ve kicked away but kicking points wasn&rsquo;t helping at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although we were doing a lot of good things, we weren&rsquo;t doing some simple things we knew we should be doing and this was making it a little
    frustrating and giving the opposition opportunities to move the ball into their forward line. We really needed to lift our talk, getting to the right spot,
    playing tighter on our opposition players and hitting the contest harder.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next 2 quarters were pretty much the same so we weren&rsquo;t able to extend our lead much that we had from quarter time. Although we were controlling
    the ball more, the game was still very close.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the last quarter things changed. We did everything we had been talking about so we really dominated the last quarter. We put on 4 goals to nothing to
    really come home strong for a great win. This is how we know we can play.
  </p>
  <p>We won 63-18.</p>
  <p>Goals. Shaylee 3, Haylee 2, Marley 2, Olivia Halse</p>
  <p>Best. Matilda, Haylee, Chloe, Milly, Shaylee, Liv Haun, Tiarnah, Riann.</p>

  <h3>Round 7</h3>
  <p>Today we played Heathmont at home. They were a few spots higher on the ladder than us so we knew it would be a tough game.</p>
  <p>The ground was quite heavy due to all the rain we had but at least it wasn&rsquo;t raining for our game.</p>
  <p>There was strong wind blowing and we were kicking against the wind in the first quarter.</p>
  <p>
    Heathmont started strong and with the wind, got a few goals up at quarter time. We had a few good plays but not as many as the other team. We were much
    better in the second quarter and had a lot more of the play but just missed a few scoring opportunities so we were down by a goal at half time. Our third
    quarter was ok but when we didn&rsquo;t man up or talk to our team mates to help them, Heathmont made us pay and drove the ball forward to extend their
    lead.
  </p>
  <p>
    We were hoping for a big last quarter but it didn&rsquo;t quite work out as planned. Heathmont had a bit more of the ball in the first half of the quarter.
    We lifted in the second half of the quarter to get a goal back but we ended going down by 2 goals.
  </p>
  <p>We lost 41-28.</p>
  <p>There wasn&rsquo;t much in it, we just need to work on a few little things to make our game more consistent.</p>
  <p>Best. Matilda, Marley, Ella, Gemma, Milly, Chloe, Haylee, Shelby</p>
  <p>Goals. Matilda 2, Shaylee Haylee</p>

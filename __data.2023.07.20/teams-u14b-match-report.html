  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    The season started off with an exciting time for Mateo, who played his 50th game for the club. North Ringwood got off to a fast start, kicking 5 goals in
    the first quarter.
  </p>
  <p>After regrouping at the first break, we identified that our pressure wasn't at the level that it needed to be.</p>
  <p>Led by the midfield, the team lifted and as such limited North Ringwood's scoring for the remainder of the game, while we kicked a few goals ourselves.</p>
  <p>
    As was seen in Sunday's game, we have set a standard, which moving forward we need to bring week in week out. If we can continue to 'bring the heat' we will
    have an enjoyable season.

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    Prior to the game, I explained to the boys that the game wasn't going to be pretty given the weather conditions. I asked them to bring effort and get their
    hands dirty. We started the game off really well with all players contributing, putting their head down and getting to work. As the game went on, we tried
    our very best but were unfortunately out played against a better outfit on the day. With players coming back, I expect us to get better, and if we continue
    to get to training and work hard a win will be around the corner. Special mentions to Xavier who run hard all day, providing us with lots of spark and
    hardness around the packs, Jordan and Zakiya in the ruck, Axel at full back and to our two new players Angus and Shevinn who looked at home on the footy
    field. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    It was a memorable occasion for the team to be a part of such a special game. Prior to the game we were able to pay our respects to the men and women that
    served and currently serve for Australia and New Zealand. At the conclusion of the last post, it was game time. Unfortunately, Lysterfield got the jump on
    us early. They were first to the ball which allowed them to play the game on their terms. &nbsp;As the game continued on, the boys didn't provide enough
    pressure to slow Lysterfield from scoring, allowing them to control the game. At three quarter time, I explained to the boys that we needed to apply more
    pressure and work harder for one another. To be teams credit, we got work and ran the game out, kicking three goals to one in the final term to earn some
    respect back. Next game Vs Vermont will be a tough game as they are each week. We need to bring the heat from the start and work harder for each other.
    Finally, a big congratulations to Tommy Walker for being awarded the Anzac Day medal for the Bayswater JFC.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>
    On Monday night during the players match review, the team identified that we had been playing some inconsistent football throughout the first three rounds.
    As such and to the team's credit we went to work on what we thought we needed to improve, prior to taking on an undefeated Vermont. &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    It was always going to be a really good test for us, taking on a team that has been a clear stand out thus far in the early part of the season. I explained
    to the players prior to the game that we would be trying some things during the game. This included many of the boys playing in positions that they hadn't
    ever played before. While we were made to work hard by Vermont, I was really proud as to how hard we worked over the four quarters.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Irrespective of what the scoreboard displayed at the end of the game, the boys walked off with their heads held high, with each of them knowing they did
    everything they could to help their mate out all game.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the game, we got to see the many of the boys do things which they hadn't done in the previous three games. One example of this was Marley providing a
    great shepherd which set up Tommy who went on to kick a great goal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the grading games have concluded, we get to reset as a team. We have set a standard of football of which we need to bring every week. If we do that a
    win will only be around the corner.
  </p>

  <h3>Round 5</h3>
  <p>
    After a great week on the training track, which saw four senior players take training on Wednesday, we took on the top of the table Boronia in Tyler
    Willoughby&rsquo;s 50th game. The weather from the outset wasn&rsquo;t the kindest to us, however we powered on.
  </p>
  <p>
    The players worked extremely hard for each other yet again, laying some hard tackles, whilst never giving up on the task at hand. During the game the
    coaches made some positional moves which gave some opportunities for many of the players who don&rsquo;t often play in these positions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although we didn&rsquo;t get the points on the day, we were again able to walk off the ground with our heads held high. Next week we play Lysterfield who we
    only played a few weeks ago. We know that if we play four quarters against them that we have a big chance of walking away with the points.
  </p>
</div>
<div id="r06" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 6</h3>
  <p>
    The weather was sparkling and the boys were ready to redeem themselves from a handful of weeks ago when Lysterfield beat us convincingly on our home ground
    in the Anzac Day clash. During the first quarter we worked really hard for each other, doing the one percenters and running hard both offensively and
    defensively. &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    As the game went on, we weren&rsquo;t able to match the opposition on the scoreboard, but we certainly made them work for their goals, while we kicked a few
    ourselves. This included a couple great goals by Gus who keeps impressing up forward. Although we lost on the day, we continue to build and work hard for
    each other. &nbsp;If we continue to do this, playing for each other, and linking up around the ground, I have no doubt a win is only around the corner. A
    special mention to Taj and Koby who both came into the game very unwell, but put on their boots as they didn&rsquo;t want to let their teammates and club
    down.
  </p>
</div>
<div id="r07" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 7</h3>
  <p>Vs Wantirna South.</p>
  <p>
    We arrived at the ground full of confidence after playing well over the past few weeks. We knew that if we played a four-quarter game, and worked hard for
    each other, that we would walk away as winners on the day. Once the ball was thrown up, we got plenty of the ball, moving it forward constantly, however we
    weren&rsquo;t making it count in the goals column, kicking to many points. &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    As the game went on, the boys kept working really well together, linking up around the ground and laying plenty of tackles. At &frac34; time, we were down
    by two goals however had a lot more to give. The coaches made a few changes which opened the play up and before we knew it, Gus kicked the first goal of the
    final quarter. With only a few minutes to go and down by a couple points, the ball landed in Ryan&rsquo;s hands who made no mistake, kicking the winning
    goal for the team, giving us our first win for the season.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we have been able to enjoy our first win for the season, moving forward I hope that it gives the team belief in knowing that we can win from any
    position as we did against Wantirna South. &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Well done and keep working hard for each other.</p>
</div>
<div id="r08" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 8</h3>
  <p>
    Off the back of last week's win against Wantirna South, the boys were up and about and ready for any challenge. We were convinced that if we started the
    game off strongly, that we would be hard to beat on the day.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    We came out all guns blazing in the first quarter, kicking the first two goals of the game. After a strong start Blackburn were able to claw their way back
    to get within two points at the main break.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    During the third quarter, we allowed Blackburn to take the lead by kicking three goals. With some hard running and the never say die attitude, we pegged two
    goals back later in the quarter, to only be down by 1 straight kick going into the final term.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the huddle at final break, we recognised that if we didn't give up and worked hard for each other as we did the previous week that we would walk away
    with the win.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, with the ground getting heavier because of the rain, and some sore/injured players, we weren't able to run over the top of Blackburn this
    time. Although we weren't able to win the game, the boys did all they could, playing a really good four quarter game.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the season is going on, we continue to improve both as a team and individuals. If we keep working hard and working for each other, another win will only
    be around the corner.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, thank you to Jono Merry and Jake Dawber for assisting the team during the game. Your efforts are much appreciated and certainly made my job a lot
    easier on the day.&nbsp;
  </p>
</div>
<div id="r09" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 9</h3>
  <p>
    We ventured to Norwood to take on a team that beat us in round 2. With the excitement of another challenge ahead, the boys took to the first quarter. After
    an even start, with both teams moving the ball well, Norwood kicked ahead to get 3 goals up on us at quarter time.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the second quarter, the boys continued to work really hard for each other, setting up plenty of opportunities up forward, but unfortunately
    weren&rsquo;t able to capitalise on these opportunities, kicking 1 goal 3 for the quarter. &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    We reset at half time and focussed on what we needed to do to get back into the game. We got back out there after the main break and played another strong
    quarter. Although we kicked 2 goals to Norwood&rsquo;s 4, I believe that we controlled most of the quarter, but gave away a couple of goals late in the
    quarter due to some undisciplined acts.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the siren went and the final quarter started, the boys lifted like I had never seen before. During the last quarter we really implemented what we have
    been learning at training and kicked 4 goals to Norwood&rsquo;s 2 to unfortunately go down by 20 points.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although we didn&rsquo;t get the win, I was extremely proud of how the team played. It is clearly noticeable from week 1 how much improvement the team has
    made, both individually and as a team.
  </p>

<div id="r10" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 10</h3>
  <p>
    This week we took on the current ladder leaders, North Ringwood at North Ringwood. We welcomed back Mitchell Knight and Ryder Beveridge who was also
    celebrating his 50th game.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>During the week we discussed that it was going to be a great test to see where we are at after North Ringwood beat us in round one.</p>
  <p>
    During the first quarter we kicked against a strong breeze. Although the weather conditions didn&rsquo;t provide us any favours, we started off really
    impressively again, setting a great tone from the start by working really hard around the packs and laying some big tackles.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    During the second and third quarters, the boys continued working really hard for each other, linking up and sharing the ball well together around the ground
    whilst placing plenty of pressure on the opposition, which made them fumble.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the last quarter, they kicked a couple goals to beat us by 4 goals. Although we didn&rsquo;t get the win, I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for any more effort
    than what the boys gave for the entire game. Reflecting on the season thus far, the team should be really proud of how far we have come from when we first
    played together in round 1.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    We have a little break now, and with three games to go I think we have a really good chance of getting another win or two. Keep coming to training and
    working hard for each other and let's enjoy the last handful of games that we will play together this season.&nbsp;

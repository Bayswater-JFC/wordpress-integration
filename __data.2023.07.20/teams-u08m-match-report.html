  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>Dear Parents and Supporters,</p>
  <p>
    Bayswater Junior Football Team Under 8s kicked off their first game of the season with an impressive display of teamwork, determination and skill. It was
    great to see all the players enjoying their footy and giving their all on the field. The game took place at Lewis Park, and our young Bayswater team played
    against Noble Park who all played in great spirits.
  </p>
  <p>
    The team with Dan had a great start to the game, with Frankie and Hattie linking up well and moving the ball forward. Despite Alyan returning for his first
    training session just last week, he took to the field seamlessly and found plenty of the ball. There were plenty of great moments from all the players which
    had their parents sharing plenty of laughs and cheers throughout the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    Scott's players also had a cracking first game out, he was impressed with the great sportsmanship shown and delighted to see all the players having fun.
    Jack got the crowd cheering with the first goal of the year and Lewis showed great awareness with 3 awesome smothers. Was great to see the team work to get
    Logan involved passing the ball around to ensure everyone got a kick.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was fantastic to see the team handballing and bringing their teammates into the game across both fields. As a team, we are continuing to develop our
    fundamental skills and our defence, it is clear that our players are taking on board the feedback from their coaches and implementing it on the field.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, it was an excellent team effort, and we are proud of the progress our players are making in both their individual skills and team play. We are
    excited to see how they continue to develop throughout the season.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you also to our trainer James and our team managers Tim and Clare for preparing us well for the first game and to all parents and supporters who came
    out to cheer on the team. Your continued support is greatly appreciated, and we look forward to seeing you all at our next game.
  </p>
  <p>Kind regards,<br />Dan and Scott</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    Well... it was wet wet wet on Sunday!<br />Big thanks to all the parents for getting their kids up and going in the middle of school holidays when the
    weather was cold, dark and wet.
  </p>
  <p>Despite the cold and wet start, everyone was enthusiastic and excited to play.</p>
  <p>
    Game 1<br />Started well with some good work in the middle of the ground by Jett and Madden working well in tandem to get the ball forward.&nbsp;<br />Harvey
    was dynamic in the forward line scoring his first goal for the season, also working well with Alyan to score goals as well.<br />In the last quarter Frankie
    and Cohen were excellent in defence, rebounding through Flynn in particular through the middle to get it into the forward line.
  </p>
  <p>
    Game 2<br />Patrick, Hattie and Pheonix were enormous all day with their continual effort around the ground and their will to be involved in the contest.
    Xavier was good up forward even managing to high 5 an Endevour Hills player after kicking a goal.<br />Max gave an exceptional effort in the 2nd half after
    some first half doubts.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />Highlights for the team were moving the ball well, great talk and using each other really well to move the ball forward. Awesome team effort despite
    the conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both games were competed in tremendous spirit given the conditions and every Baswater player was very excited to play for the opposition given we had 17 and
    they had 9 across the 2 fields.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Great game by all</p>
  <p>Bring on next week!</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    Bayswater JFC Under 8&rsquo;s took the field on Round 3 against the Basin Bears, in what was a special day for both teams to commemorate Anzac Day. The game
    was played in great spirits by all involved, and it was an honour for our players to mark such an important occasion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout the game, both teams displayed tremendous sportsmanship, and our players should be proud of their efforts. Harvey was instrumental in sharing the
    ball around and played a great team game, while Alyan took some excellent contested marks and showed great composure under pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Phoenix demonstrated amazing pace, with few able to keep up with her on several occasions, as she made some exciting runs towards goal. Our team's
    commitment to teamwork and communication paid dividends, as we worked hard to support each other both defensively and offensively.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Basin Coach's awarded Anzac Medals to Declan and Randall for their outstanding performances on the day, and we congratulate them both for their efforts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, it was another positive performance from our team, and we are excited about the progress that we continue to make as a group. We look forward to

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>
    Bayswater JFC under 8's took on the Ferntree Gully Eagles in Round 4 on a frosty Saturday morning. The team was in great spirits, following a number taking
    part in mini match during the half time break of the Bayswater Seniors game the day before.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;Despite the chilly start to the day, the weather turned out to be perfect for footy. The team displayed excellent teamwork and showed no signs of
    slowing down. Phoenix continued to impress with her relentless running, while Hudson used his height to his advantage, knocking the ball towards goal out of
    the middle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Johnny's never-say-die attitude was reminiscent of the Collingwood side's fightback late in the game. Meanwhile, Hattie had a great game, finding the ball
    with some excited cheering from her siblings on the sideline.
  </p>
  <p>Logan was hard at it all day, attacking the contested balls fearlessly. Xavier had a standout performance, dominating up and down the field.</p>
  <p>
    Overall, it was another great display of teamwork from the Bayswater U8's, building on their progress from the previous week. The team is looking forward to
    building on this performance in the next round.
  </p>

  <h3>Round 5</h3>
  <p>Game 1</p>
  <p>
    Starting the game with the focus of working together and passing the ball on the move. Starting positively Cohen worked really well with Declan down forward
    in the first quarter, both having opportunities to take some shots at goal.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the second quarter Hudson and Jack in the middle, worked really well as a combo both working well as ruck and rover feeding the ball to Logan getting it
    forward.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the half time oranges we had a slow start, under pressure Jett worked really hard intercepting kicks and running to get some space in defence. Jack
    continued his good work down back supporting Jett with some intercept marking and a strong presence.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the last quarter the team reset to focus on running each players 10 metres when they got the ball. From the first ball up the team started to move the
    ball really well, Harvey moving the ball forward from the middle. Linking handballs and hitting targets with kicks, the team moved and passed together to
    finish the game really strongly
  </p>
  <p>Game 2</p>
  <p>
    As with game 1, the focus was on teamwork and shortening our passes. The 1st quarter was exactly what we asked with Randall working extremely well with the
    mids and forwards to get us off to a great start. The second quarter was much of the same with some really good ball movement from Madden and phoenix.
    Franke had some really nice shots on goal in the 3rd qtr that really had the crowd and goal umpire up and about. Johnny and Flynn found some spice and
    attacked the ball like I've never seen before. In the last qtr it was Patrick (who battled hard with 2 quarters in the back line) finally got on the board
    with a nice assist from Lewis.
  </p>
  <p>A fantastic team event by all.</p>
  <p>Special shout out to the umpire who usually Umpires older age groups. She was amazing with the kids.</p>
  <p>Go Bayswater!</p>

  <h3>Round 6</h3>

    determination and teamwork on the field.
  </p>
  <p>
    The focus for the day was "Be First and Be in Front," with the aim of encouraging our players to attack the contested ball and give themselves the best
    opportunity to gain possession. This emphasis was evident throughout the game as our players fearlessly went after the ball.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jett and Frankie demonstrated excellent collaboration, working together to move the ball towards the goal. Their cohesive play helped create scoring
    opportunities for the team. Xavier showcased his exceptional leading skills, consistently finding space and being rewarded by his teammates.
  </p>
  <p>

  <h3>Round 7</h3>
  <p>
    Bayswater JFC under 8's had an eventful Round 7 match against Vermont. It was the first game in a while where we faced a team with fewer players, and it was
    great to witness our players stepping up and volunteering to play a quarter for Vermont. Their display of sportsmanship was commendable, and it was
    fantastic to see them enjoying the friendly competition against their own teammates.
  </p>
  <p>
    The focus for today's game was to encourage our players to attack the contest and position themselves at the back of the contest to receive the handball,
    thus avoiding a crowded forward line. The team responded exceptionally well to this instruction, and it was evident that the hard work put in during
    training was paying off. Patrick was the first to demonstrate this during the game by calling for the ball out the back, showcasing the team's understanding
    of the game plan.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cohen fought hard to win the ball and showed great determination as he finished with a goal, leaving a huge smile on his face. Lewis, displaying admirable
    sportsmanship, played twice for Vermont and exhibited immense courage by returning to the field after taking a ball to the face, resulting in a
    blood-stained jumper for his parents to wash.
  </p>
  <p>
    Max embraced the team plan with enthusiasm, consistently attacking the ball throughout the game. Hudson demonstrated excellent handball skills, executing
    some impressive link-ups with his teammates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Flynn and Madden showed great responsiveness to the training work, positioning themselves at the back of play to receive the ball by hand. Their
    understanding and execution of this tactic were evident during the match, reflecting their commitment to improving their skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, it was a memorable game filled with sportsmanship, teamwork, and skill development. The players should be proud of their performance and the way
    they embraced the game plan. Their enthusiasm and willingness to support one another were key factors in their success.
  </p>
  <p>Congratulations to all the players for their efforts, and let's carry this positive momentum forward to the next challenge.</p>

  <h3>Round 10</h3>
  <p>
    Bayswater JFC under 8's had an exciting match in Round 10 against the Rowville Hawks. After a week's rest, it was great to be back on the field and resume
    the action.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the past few weeks, our focus has been on finding a target out of the middle or at least landing the ball forward of the goals, allowing our forwards
    to contest the footy. This strategy has proven to be highly effective, as it brings more players into the game and sets us up for future success. Developing
    the ability to hit targets in our forward line will be crucial in the coming years.
  </p>
  <p>
    The team displayed excellent teamwork across both the field, with remarkable and effective handballing being a standout feature of our play. Players
    demonstrated great vision and decision-making, getting to the back of play to receive a handball creating scoring opportunities for the team.
  </p>
  <p>Declan, Johnny, and Hudson showcased their skills by scoring some fantastic goals. Great to see the team celebrating with high fives across the ground.</p>
  <p>Jack and Jett exhibited great determination attacking the contest and running the ball up field.</p>
  <p>
    Patrick displayed outstanding goalkeeping skills, demonstrating a strong game sense by pushing back and manning the goal square. His efforts resulted in few
    brilliant saves, denying the opposition from scoring on multiple occasions which he also seemed quite chuffed with.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking ahead, we are excited to have everyone back at training on Friday. The progress we have made as a team is evident, and we are eager to continue
    working together to further develop our skills and teamwork.
  </p>
  <p>
    Congratulations to all the players for their contributions in the match, looking forward to having lots of fun with the last few games left of the season.

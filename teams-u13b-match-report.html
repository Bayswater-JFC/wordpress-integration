  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    Congratulations to Seth and Jaxon both playing their 50th games today. These two boys have been fantastic players for Bayswater during their junior career.
    We hope for another 50 games at least.
  </p>
  <p>The following players also played their first games with Bayswater today:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cooper Leach</li>
    <li>Austin</li>
    <li>Charles</li>
    <li>Xane&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Well done to these boys and welcome to the team.</p>
  <p>
    Today was a nice start to the season with all players contributing throughout the day. Our drive from Dusty, Hamish and Marley in the middle all day was
    outstanding. These boys will be a solid midfield unit this season.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'd also like to say thank you to the 8 boys who played a quarter with Croydon South. I know they put in their best efforts when playing with them. As
    mentioned a few months back, the change to the even up rule may see more games where this happens.
  </p>
  <p>
    We saw 10 individual goal kickers, showing great team work throughout the day. We were even able to talk Seth out of the backline for a quarter, giving him
    the chance to score a rare goal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, both Gavin and I were pleased with the effort today. There were some sensational passages of play and great team unity. We expect to see continual
    improvement over the coming weeks as they boys get back into the flow of the season. This improvement is critical as harder games come our way.
  </p>
  <p>Go Baysie.</p>

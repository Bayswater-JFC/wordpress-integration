  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    Congratulations to Seth and Jaxon both playing their 50th games today. These two boys have been fantastic players for Bayswater during their junior career.
    We hope for another 50 games at least.
  </p>
  <p>The following players also played their first games with Bayswater today:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cooper Leach</li>
    <li>Austin</li>
    <li>Charles</li>
    <li>Xane&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Well done to these boys and welcome to the team.</p>
  <p>
    Today was a nice start to the season with all players contributing throughout the day. Our drive from Dusty, Hamish and Marley in the middle all day was
    outstanding. These boys will be a solid midfield unit this season.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'd also like to say thank you to the 8 boys who played a quarter with Croydon South. I know they put in their best efforts when playing with them. As
    mentioned a few months back, the change to the even up rule may see more games where this happens.
  </p>
  <p>
    We saw 10 individual goal kickers, showing great team work throughout the day. We were even able to talk Seth out of the backline for a quarter, giving him
    the chance to score a rare goal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, both Gavin and I were pleased with the effort today. There were some sensational passages of play and great team unity. We expect to see continual
    improvement over the coming weeks as they boys get back into the flow of the season. This improvement is critical as harder games come our way.
  </p>
  <p>Go Baysie.</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>A well fought out win by the boys today, in a tough 4 quarter tussle against a solid opponent.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    Today we rotated our midfield given the size of the ground. This gave an opportunity to Seth, Phoenix, Cooper Leach, Marley, Dusty and Cooper Lancaster all
    spending time on the ball.
  </p>
  <p>We also rotated our ruck, giving Lachie, Hamish and Kirby time in this spot.</p>
  <p>A real standout game today by Cooper Lancaster, who looked at ease playing through the midfield. This was definitely his most complete game so far.</p>
  <p>
    Our backline also had its busiest day for some time, and they all stood strong resisting many attacks. Dusty played well taking several intercept marks,
    with Lachie and Kirby being extremely solid across half back. Charles, playing in just his second game, used his body positioning with great skill.
  </p>
  <p>
    We spoke with boys today about overusing the ball as we looked much better when kicking long. This overuse cost us dearly at times and could've had a
    significant impact on the end result.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall a good result against, but as I said last week, every game will be challenging and the boys will need to be near their best each week if we're to
    remain competitive.
  </p>
  <p>We are looking forward to the boys continuing to improve every week.</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    Our winning streak has come to an end. 18 home and away wins in a row is an outstanding effort from this team and we should all be very proud of this
    sustained success.
  </p>
  <p>
    We were competitive all day yesterday and remained in the game until the final few minutes. Our conversion on goal was one of the key factors in the result.
    Kicking 9 points in a row hurt. You also get those days where the ball bounces the wrong way, you run under the ball or a kick lands just short or you
    narrowly miss a goal. Yesterday was that day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our conversations at the breaks really focused on the lack of hard ball gets, being accountable to each other, talk on the field and quick ball movement.
    These are the next steps the team need to take to become a better unit.
  </p>
  <p>Saying this, there were positives yesterday, there were some great passages of play. The drive from our back was exceptional.</p>
  <p>
    One of stand out plays was an Dusty attacking the ball from full back, kicking to Phoenix on the wing, he then followed up his kick taking the handball from
    Phoenix going for a run and kicking it to our advantage in the forward line, just narrowly missing a goal. This is a key example of all of the things we've
    been talking about and we hope that this type of play inspires others in the team to do the same.
  </p>
  <p>Yesterday we did throw some of the magnets around playing some of the boys out of position, we want the boys to be comfortable in multiple positions.</p>
  <p>
    What we are impressed with is the development of new players, such as Nolan, Xane and Charles. We know these boys need game time to improve but we can see
    glimpses already.
  </p>
  <p>This week's game will be another tough one and communication and hard ball gets will be the focus of this week's training.</p>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>In the true spirit of Anzac day, our boys went into a game with 3 injured players bringing us down to 17.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We set some team goals today, quarter by quarter and broken up into sections of the ground, forwards, midfield and defenders.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    I think the boys tried their best to fulfil those goals each quarter. Chirnside Park got the jump on the boys early, our communication was down, which is
    something we are really trying to emphasise and work on with the boys at training.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    In the second quarter I asked the forwards to out score their opponent, and they did, kicking 1 goal 1, to Chirnside's 1 point. There was some great
    passages of play, and good link up footy, that the boys played so well. We went into the half down, but not beaten.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Going into the 3rd quarter, only 2 goals down I really felt the boys were in this game. The ball did not bounce our way, but the boys pressed on. Our
    pressure on the ball was good in parts and our delivery was mostly on point, the boys skill level is definitely increasing game by game. Chirnside know how
    to play their ground though, they kicked long with the wind, and got 4 goals. The back line was attacking the ball at almost every contest, with at least
    one cheeky goal scored by a wicked bounce.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    In the last quarter we were 40 points down. I knew the boys were tired, and I asked them to really dig deep and finish this game with pride. The boys really
    came together then, they put their bodies on the line, they played on when they could, they ran out of the backline in numbers and drove that ball forward
    as a TEAM. Cooper L, ran out of the back line with protection, delivering the ball to Seth then he hit Lachy on the chest, that was probably the play of the
    day for me and shows what you boys are really capable of !! We repeated almost that same play not long after, and Nolan took a great mark and delivered the
    ball beautifully again to CHF. We out scored our opponent again in the last quarter, to which I was super proud of the effort you all put in today. You
    didn't lie down and give up, you showed true fighting spirit and showed us how good you boys really can be, when you play for each other.<br />&nbsp;<br />Congratulations
    to Lachy for winning the Anzac medal today as awarded by Chirnside Park.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Guys there are so many positives out of today, keep your heads up.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We'd also like to express our condolences to the Dinnage family.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Round 5</h3>
  <p>
    Congratulations to Cooper Leach who played his 50th game on Sunday. He had been sitting on 49 games for 3 weeks. It was great to have him back in the team.
  </p>
  <p>It was also great to get back on the winners board after two losses.</p>
  <p>We had 9 individual goal kickers, led by Lachie with 7 majors, with Dusty, Cooper Leach, Phoenix and Marley all kicking multiple goals.</p>
  <p>
    Our game plan was to come out and assert some early dominance, so we decided to start with taller players in the middle, luckily this paid off creating an
    early lead and by half time the game was pretty much over.
  </p>
  <p>Some other stand outs for the game:-</p>
  <p>
    Nolan for his tireless gut running up and down the wing all day. He helped in defence and created options in our forward line. He continues to improve each
    week. What is even more astounding is the fact he hadn't touched a football until about 3 months ago and is still learning the rules.
  </p>
  <p>Ben for his last quarter playing in the midfield. Ben had been down on confidence and spending time on the ball saw his natural game style come back.</p>
  <p>Austin, for his multiple 1% plays that don't count as a stat but helps the team</p>
  <p>Cooper Lancaster for his 3 bounce run out of full back....wow, sometimes it looks like his feet don't hit the ground</p>
  <p>
    Overall we were pleased with the team game. All players worked together and it was the game style we've been working on for some time, so it's great to see
    it come off.
  </p>
  <p>Well done to the boys on a great win.</p>
  <p>P.S the ladder is up, the game against Croydon South didn't count as they were relegated after round 2, so we are sitting on 2 wins &amp; 2 losses.</p>

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    Congratulations to Seth and Jaxon both playing their 50th games today. These two boys have been fantastic players for Bayswater during their junior career.
    We hope for another 50 games at least.
  </p>
  <p>The following players also played their first games with Bayswater today:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cooper Leach</li>
    <li>Austin</li>
    <li>Charles</li>
    <li>Xane&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Well done to these boys and welcome to the team.</p>
  <p>
    Today was a nice start to the season with all players contributing throughout the day. Our drive from Dusty, Hamish and Marley in the middle all day was
    outstanding. These boys will be a solid midfield unit this season.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'd also like to say thank you to the 8 boys who played a quarter with Croydon South. I know they put in their best efforts when playing with them. As
    mentioned a few months back, the change to the even up rule may see more games where this happens.
  </p>
  <p>
    We saw 10 individual goal kickers, showing great team work throughout the day. We were even able to talk Seth out of the backline for a quarter, giving him
    the chance to score a rare goal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, both Gavin and I were pleased with the effort today. There were some sensational passages of play and great team unity. We expect to see continual
    improvement over the coming weeks as they boys get back into the flow of the season. This improvement is critical as harder games come our way.
  </p>
  <p>Go Baysie.</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>A well fought out win by the boys today, in a tough 4 quarter tussle against a solid opponent.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    Today we rotated our midfield given the size of the ground. This gave an opportunity to Seth, Phoenix, Cooper Leach, Marley, Dusty and Cooper Lancaster all
    spending time on the ball.
  </p>
  <p>We also rotated our ruck, giving Lachie, Hamish and Kirby time in this spot.</p>
  <p>A real standout game today by Cooper Lancaster, who looked at ease playing through the midfield. This was definitely his most complete game so far.</p>
  <p>
    Our backline also had its busiest day for some time, and they all stood strong resisting many attacks. Dusty played well taking several intercept marks,
    with Lachie and Kirby being extremely solid across half back. Charles, playing in just his second game, used his body positioning with great skill.
  </p>
  <p>
    We spoke with boys today about overusing the ball as we looked much better when kicking long. This overuse cost us dearly at times and could've had a
    significant impact on the end result.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall a good result against, but as I said last week, every game will be challenging and the boys will need to be near their best each week if we're to
    remain competitive.
  </p>
  <p>We are looking forward to the boys continuing to improve every week.</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    Our winning streak has come to an end. 18 home and away wins in a row is an outstanding effort from this team and we should all be very proud of this
    sustained success.
  </p>
  <p>
    We were competitive all day yesterday and remained in the game until the final few minutes. Our conversion on goal was one of the key factors in the result.
    Kicking 9 points in a row hurt. You also get those days where the ball bounces the wrong way, you run under the ball or a kick lands just short or you
    narrowly miss a goal. Yesterday was that day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our conversations at the breaks really focused on the lack of hard ball gets, being accountable to each other, talk on the field and quick ball movement.
    These are the next steps the team need to take to become a better unit.
  </p>
  <p>Saying this, there were positives yesterday, there were some great passages of play. The drive from our back was exceptional.</p>
  <p>
    One of stand out plays was an Dusty attacking the ball from full back, kicking to Phoenix on the wing, he then followed up his kick taking the handball from
    Phoenix going for a run and kicking it to our advantage in the forward line, just narrowly missing a goal. This is a key example of all of the things we've
    been talking about and we hope that this type of play inspires others in the team to do the same.
  </p>
  <p>Yesterday we did throw some of the magnets around playing some of the boys out of position, we want the boys to be comfortable in multiple positions.</p>
  <p>
    What we are impressed with is the development of new players, such as Nolan, Xane and Charles. We know these boys need game time to improve but we can see
    glimpses already.
  </p>
  <p>This week's game will be another tough one and communication and hard ball gets will be the focus of this week's training.</p>

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>Today we played our first game of the season. It rained for a fair part of the day but lucky for us, we got no rain for the game.</p>
  <p>We started the game really well. Our more experienced girls took charge and controlled the game. We had a very good lead at quarter time.</p>
  <p>
    After the first quarter and with a big lead, we mixed things up and moved everyone around and gave some of our less experienced players more opportunities
    to play on the ball. We continued to dominate the game with all players having a go and making the most of it when the ball came their way. Nice to see some
    of our quieter girls coming out of their shells.
  </p>
  <p>We have definitely improved since our practice match which was very encouraging to see.</p>
  <p>Goals. Haylee 6, Shaylee 5, Matilda 2, Milly 2, Tiarnah, Jess</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>Today we played Boronia at their senior ground which is a big ground.</p>
  <p>We had a few players out so we only had 16 players against 20 for Boronia so we played with no bench.</p>
  <p>We knew it was going to be a tough game with Boronia winning the flag last year and them having girls resting on the bench.</p>
  <p>We went in with a very positive attitude and to try and play the best we can and making sure we talked and helped each other.</p>
  <p>We started really well. It was pretty close in the first quarter but we worked a little bit harder to get a good lead at quarter time.</p>
  <p>The second quarter was very even again but as we got tired, Boronia were able to kick a couple of goals to even things up at half time.</p>
  <p>The second half was challenging for us and you could see the girls getting tired as the game went on, having no bench to rest the players.</p>
  <p>Boronia probably had a bit more of the ball than us but our backline stood strong and did an amazing job to stop them kicking goals.</p>
  <p>It was a very close finish but we ended up winning by 3 points even though the other team had more scoring shots.</p>
  <p>The game could&rsquo;ve gone either way and luckily for us, it went our way.</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    It was a really nice day for footy and with the girls having a well fought out win last week, their confidence was high and were looking forward to having a
    good game.
  </p>
  <p>
    Montrose started very strong so it was a good contest by both sides. We were working hard but we just fell down in a couple of areas which enabled Montrose
    to be in front.
  </p>
  <p>
    The game continued in the same fashion. It was very close but they just had the upper hand on us when we weren&rsquo;t as good as we needed to be in a
    couple of areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    We fought the game right out and had more of the ball in the last quarter but couldn&rsquo;t get the goals on the board that we needed. We ended up losing
    by 4 points.
  </p>
  <p>
    The areas that we feel done on are only small things so if the girls work hard at training, I&rsquo;m sure we can improve on these and play more
    consistently.

  <p>Goals. Haylee 2, Jade.</p>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>An absolutely awesome day to play footy and pay tribute to ANZAC Day.</p>
  <p>Our warm up today was very ordinary so I was a little worried how the girls would start the day.</p>
  <p>I gave them a bit of a razz up before the game hoping it would switch them on a bit more.</p>
  <p>
    Luckily we started the game quite well. Both teams came out working hard and applying lots of pressure. We were winning a bit more of the ball so we came in
    at quarter time up on the scoreboard. We were able to keep playing at the same level for most of the game so there were times that Chirnside Park were in
    control of the play but we were definitely in control of the play more often than Chirnside Park. Each quarter we were able to extend our lead to have a
    really good win 69-32.
  </p>
  <p>They are still a few things we need to work on to improve but most of our game was really good.</p>
  <p>Goals. Haylee 6, Shaylee 2, Chloe, Lara</p>
  <p>Best. Haylee, Milly, Matilda, Chloe, Shaylee, Jade, Shae, Sanvi, Riann, Lara</p>

  <h3>Round 5</h3>
  <p>We played South Croydon at home today.</p>
  <p>Another really nice day for footy. Croydon South are a good team so we knew it was going to be a tough game today.</p>
  <p>
    The game started pretty even. Both teams had their moments when they had more of the ball. We had it a bit more in the first half of the quarter and Croydon
    South in the second half of the quarter. Through inaccurate kicking by the other team, we were in front at quarter time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second quarter was the same as the first. Both teams had their moments but Croydon South were just working a little bit harder than us so able to get
    the ball a bit more. This seemed to be the way the game continued in the second half. We were playing well at times but not nearly enough to try and reduce
    Croydon South&rsquo;s lead and they increased their lead even more. The other team came home with a fairly relaxed win as they did control a lot more of the
    ball than we did.
  </p>
  <p>
    On reflection, we didn't have enough players that stood up. We probably had 6 solid performers for the day and that&rsquo;s not enough against the good
    sides. It's really a few small things we need to get much better at but it definitely hurts our performance when we don&rsquo;t have enough players doing
    them.
  </p>
  <p>We lost 40-16</p>

  <h3>Round 6</h3>
  <p>Today we played Montrose at their home ground.</p>
  <p>
    We had 5 players out due to injury or being sick so we weren&rsquo;t flush with numbers. One of the girls away was our captain so I was really keen for the
    girls to lift to help cover the leadership we get from our captain.
  </p>
  <p>Our warm up wasn&rsquo;t great so I was a little worried that we weren&rsquo;t focused enough to start the game.</p>
  <p>Much to my surprise, our leadership group started really well and set the tone for the other girls.</p>
  <p>It was a very even game so it was going to come down to which team would do more things right and minimise the things they don&rsquo;t do so well.</p>
  <p>
    We took an early lead and we were able to maintain that for most of the game. We only had 1 on the bench compared to their 6 so I was a little concerned how
    we would play the game out. As the game went on, Montrose started to close in on the lead we had. We lost a player due to injury and then we lost another,
    so we played most of the last quarter with 1 player less than Montrose on the field.
  </p>
  <p>When things got really hard, I was really impressed that they all dug deep and pushed right to the end of the game. We ended up with a win by 3 points.</p>
  <p>Score 17 &ndash; 14</p>

  <h3>Round 7</h3>
  <p>
    â€‹Today we played Boronia at their home ground. Last time we played them we had a very close game so I was expecting another close one. It was a wet wintery
    day so just hoping it wasn&rsquo;t going to rain too much when we played.
  </p>
  <p>
    Boronia got off to a better start than us. Their want and desire to get the ball was at a higher level than ours so they were winning the ball more often
    than us. We weren&rsquo;t manning up enough so Boronia were taking advantage of their loose players. Although we weren&rsquo;t down by much at quarter time,
    we definitely had less of the ball. It was a similar result in the second quarter. Through our lack of talk, we lacked confidence to get the ball so once
    again, we were having to tackle the opposition rather than getting the ball ourselves and kicking it our way.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a chat at half time, I was hoping to turn things around but that didn&rsquo;t happen. Unfortunately &nbsp;that didn&rsquo;t happen so the backline had
    their work cut out for them.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the last quarter, Boronia scored a couple of quick goals so it was looking like it might blow out a bit but credit to the girls, they dug deep and we
    were able to kick a couple of goals to narrow the lead. Unfortunately, they were just too strong for us and we went down 41-18.

  <h3>Round 8</h3>
  <p>
    Today was a big game for our team. We were playing Waverley Blues at home and we had heard they were a pretty quick team so we needed to be on the ball.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also had our captain Matilda playing her 100th game so that was exciting for the playing group but gave us a little more reason to play well and
    hopefully get the win.
  </p>
  <p>
    The game started how most games do. Both teams were full of energy and showed a lot of eagerness to get the ball. It was pretty even for most of the quarter
    but there were times we had a bit more of the ball which helped us get an early lead at quarter time. The second quarter was pretty similar but it seemed
    like there was a scoring end and Waverly was kicking to that end so they caught back our lead to be even at half time.
  </p>
  <p>The third quarter was very even again but we had the scoring end so we were able to get a 2 goal lead by three quarter time.</p>
  <p>
    We needed to dig deep and the last quarter to try and hold onto our lead. We didn&rsquo;t start the last quarter very well at all. We seemed to lose our
    concentration for a bit so we weren&rsquo;t picking up our players or attacking the ball how we should so Waverley had a lot of the ball for the first part
    of the last quarter. A little lucky for us that they missed a couple of shots for goal so we stayed in front. Once we switched back on, we got back to doing
    what we needed to do and managed to kick a couple of goals making sure we won the game. We won 47-33.
  </p>
  <p>We had a lot of girls step up today which really made a difference for our team.</p>
  <p>One of our best team efforts this year so far.</p>
  <p>Goals. Haylee 3, Shaylee 2, Milly, Tiarnah.</p>

<div id="r10" style="display: none">
  <h3>Round 10</h3>
  <p>We played Montrose at home today.</p>
  <p>Definitely starting to feel like winter now as it was really cold but no rain which was good and the ground was in good condition.</p>
  <p>We were really looking to play well today to put ourselves in a good position to play finals and it was also Carly&rsquo;s 50th game.</p>
  <p>
    We started really well. The girls were working hard and supporting each other and we had a lot of the ball. Unfortunately we were unable to kick any goals
    and Montrose kicked a late goal to take the lead at quarter time.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the second quarter, our effort levels dropped and Montrose were able to win more of the ball and kick some more goals. This trend continued for the rest
    of the game. We did have a few really good moments but not nearly enough to change the outcome.
  </p>
  <p>We lost 37-13.</p>
  <p>
    We definitely have the ability to play a lot better than how we played today. A fair few of the players &nbsp;also realised that our effort level
    wasn&rsquo;t good enough today so this gives us an opportunity to work on this at training and improve in that area.
  </p>
  <p>With the other sides all improving, we need to improve as well to stay competitive.</p>
  <p>Hopefully we can bounce back next week.</p>

  <h3>Round 11</h3>
  <p>Today we played South Croydon at their home ground.</p>
  <p>I was away on holidays so my assistant coaches Daniel and Brent coached the girls.</p>
  <p>South Croydon were on top of the ladder so it was always going to be a tough game.</p>
  <p>We did lose 56-30 but the coaches for the day said they tried hard all day, we were just beaten by a better team.</p>

  <h3>Round 12</h3>
  <p>Today we had Boronia at their big senior ground. It was a very cold winter day so we needed to get ourselves up for the challenge.</p>
  <p>We really wanted a win today to increase our chances of making the finals.</p>
  <p>
    We started very well and the first quarter was very even. At quarter time we talked about what was working well for us and things we needed to improve to
    play better footy.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first half of the second quarter was tight so it was anyone&rsquo;s game but in the second half of the quarter, Boronia edged away. They were just a bit
    more disciplined than us and that makes a difference in these wet, cold conditions. They got the lead on us at half time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second half continued in the same fashion. Boronia were just working a bit harder than us resulting in them having a bit more of the ball. We kept
    trying all game but didn&rsquo;t quite have what we needed to claw back their lead.
  </p>
  <p>We went down 26-0.</p>

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>Today we played our first game of the season. It rained for a fair part of the day but lucky for us, we got no rain for the game.</p>
  <p>We started the game really well. Our more experienced girls took charge and controlled the game. We had a very good lead at quarter time.</p>
  <p>
    After the first quarter and with a big lead, we mixed things up and moved everyone around and gave some of our less experienced players more opportunities
    to play on the ball. We continued to dominate the game with all players having a go and making the most of it when the ball came their way. Nice to see some
    of our quieter girls coming out of their shells.
  </p>
  <p>We have definitely improved since our practice match which was very encouraging to see.</p>
  <p>Goals. Haylee 6, Shaylee 5, Matilda 2, Milly 2, Tiarnah, Jess</p>
  <p>Best. Matilda, Haylee, Chloe, Milly, Shaylee, Jade, Gemma</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>Today we played Boronia at their senior ground which is a big ground.</p>
  <p>We had a few players out so we only had 16 players against 20 for Boronia so we played with no bench.</p>
  <p>We knew it was going to be a tough game with Boronia winning the flag last year and them having girls resting on the bench.</p>
  <p>We went in with a very positive attitude and to try and play the best we can and making sure we talked and helped each other.</p>
  <p>We started really well. It was pretty close in the first quarter but we worked a little bit harder to get a good lead at quarter time.</p>
  <p>The second quarter was very even again but as we got tired, Boronia were able to kick a couple of goals to even things up at half time.</p>
  <p>The second half was challenging for us and you could see the girls getting tired as the game went on, having no bench to rest the players.</p>
  <p>Boronia probably had a bit more of the ball than us but our backline stood strong and did an amazing job to stop them kicking goals.</p>
  <p>It was a very close finish but we ended up winning by 3 points even though the other team had more scoring shots.</p>
  <p>The game could&rsquo;ve gone either way and luckily for us, it went our way.</p>
  <p>Goals. Haylee, Matilda, Shaylee</p>

  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    It was a really nice day for footy and with the girls having a well fought out win last week, their confidence was high and were looking forward to having a
    good game.
  </p>
  <p>
    Montrose started very strong so it was a good contest by both sides. We were working hard but we just fell down in a couple of areas which enabled Montrose
    to be in front.
  </p>
  <p>
    The game continued in the same fashion. It was very close but they just had the upper hand on us when we weren&rsquo;t as good as we needed to be in a
    couple of areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    We fought the game right out and had more of the ball in the last quarter but couldn&rsquo;t get the goals on the board that we needed. We ended up losing
    by 4 points.
  </p>
  <p>
    The areas that we feel done on are only small things so if the girls work hard at training, I&rsquo;m sure we can improve on these and play more
    consistently.
  </p>
  <p>Goals. Haylee 2, Jade.</p>
  <p>Best. Haylee, Milly, Jade, Chloe, Gemma, Tiarnah, Keelie</p>

  <h3>Round 4</h3>
  <p>An absolutely awesome day to play footy and pay tribute to ANZAC Day.</p>
  <p>Our warm up today was very ordinary so I was a little worried how the girls would start the day.</p>
  <p>I gave them a bit of a razz up before the game hoping it would switch them on a bit more.</p>
  <p>
    Luckily we started the game quite well. Both teams came out working hard and applying lots of pressure. We were winning a bit more of the ball so we came in
    at quarter time up on the scoreboard. We were able to keep playing at the same level for most of the game so there were times that Chirnside Park were in
    control of the play but we were definitely in control of the play more often than Chirnside Park. Each quarter we were able to extend our lead to have a
    really good win 69-32.
  </p>
  <p>They are still a few things we need to work on to improve but most of our game was really good.</p>
  <p>Goals. Haylee 6, Shaylee 2, Chloe, Lara</p>
  <p>Best. Haylee, Milly, Matilda, Chloe, Shaylee, Jade, Shae, Sanvi, Riann, Lara</p>

  <h3>Round 5</h3>
  <p>We played South Croydon at home today.</p>
  <p>Another really nice day for footy. Croydon South are a good team so we knew it was going to be a tough game today.</p>
  <p>
    The game started pretty even. Both teams had their moments when they had more of the ball. We had it a bit more in the first half of the quarter and Croydon
    South in the second half of the quarter. Through inaccurate kicking by the other team, we were in front at quarter time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second quarter was the same as the first. Both teams had their moments but Croydon South were just working a little bit harder than us so able to get
    the ball a bit more. This seemed to be the way the game continued in the second half. We were playing well at times but not nearly enough to try and reduce
    Croydon South&rsquo;s lead and they increased their lead even more. The other team came home with a fairly relaxed win as they did control a lot more of the
    ball than we did.
  </p>
  <p>
    On reflection, we didn't have enough players that stood up. We probably had 6 solid performers for the day and that&rsquo;s not enough against the good
    sides. It's really a few small things we need to get much better at but it definitely hurts our performance when we don&rsquo;t have enough players doing
    them.
  </p>
  <p>We lost 40-16</p>
  <p>Goals. Haylee 2</p>
  <p>Best. Haylee, Matilda, Milly, Chloe, Tiarnah, Jade, Keelie, Keely</p>

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>Today we played our first game of the season. It rained for a fair part of the day but lucky for us, we got no rain for the game.</p>
  <p>We started the game really well. Our more experienced girls took charge and controlled the game. We had a very good lead at quarter time.</p>
  <p>
    After the first quarter and with a big lead, we mixed things up and moved everyone around and gave some of our less experienced players more opportunities
    to play on the ball. We continued to dominate the game with all players having a go and making the most of it when the ball came their way. Nice to see some
    of our quieter girls coming out of their shells.
  </p>
  <p>We have definitely improved since our practice match which was very encouraging to see.</p>
  <p>Goals. Haylee 6, Shaylee 5, Matilda 2, Milly 2, Tiarnah, Jess</p>
  <p>Best. Matilda, Haylee, Chloe, Milly, Shaylee, Jade, Gemma</p>

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>Today we played our first game of the season. It rained for a fair part of the day but lucky for us, we got no rain for the game.</p>
  <p>We started the game really well. Our more experienced girls took charge and controlled the game. We had a very good lead at quarter time.</p>
  <p>
    After the first quarter and with a big lead, we mixed things up and moved everyone around and gave some of our less experienced players more opportunities
    to play on the ball. We continued to dominate the game with all players having a go and making the most of it when the ball came their way. Nice to see some
    of our quieter girls coming out of their shells.
  </p>
  <p>We have definitely improved since our practice match which was very encouraging to see.</p>
  <p>Goals. Haylee 6, Shaylee 5, Matilda 2, Milly 2, Tiarnah, Jess</p>
  <p>Best. Matilda, Haylee, Chloe, Milly, Shaylee, Jade, Gemma</p>

  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>Today we played Boronia at their senior ground which is a big ground.</p>
  <p>We had a few players out so we only had 16 players against 20 for Boronia so we played with no bench.</p>
  <p>We knew it was going to be a tough game with Boronia winning the flag last year and them having girls resting on the bench.</p>
  <p>We went in with a very positive attitude and to try and play the best we can and making sure we talked and helped each other.</p>
  <p>We started really well. It was pretty close in the first quarter but we worked a little bit harder to get a good lead at quarter time.</p>
  <p>The second quarter was very even again but as we got tired, Boronia were able to kick a couple of goals to even things up at half time.</p>
  <p>The second half was challenging for us and you could see the girls getting tired as the game went on, having no bench to rest the players.</p>
  <p>Boronia probably had a bit more of the ball than us but our backline stood strong and did an amazing job to stop them kicking goals.</p>
  <p>It was a very close finish but we ended up winning by 3 points even though the other team had more scoring shots.</p>
  <p>The game could&rsquo;ve gone either way and luckily for us, it went our way.</p>
  <p>Goals. Haylee, Matilda, Shaylee</p>
  <p>Best. Matilda, Shaylee, Haylee, Milly, Chloe, Ella, Saanvi, Tiarnah.</p>

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    First game of the year against Montrose at home we were informed on Friday they only had 17 boys and we agreed to play 16 aside. As we had 8 on the bench it
    made it hard to keep rotations and our game plans and structures together but credit to everyone , parents and boys we worked well as a group. We started
    very well with 8 goals to 2 in the first with great pressure Montrose came back in the second and by halftime it was 10.3 to 4.4. We reinforced our messages
    to the group and they responded with a 3 goal to 1 third quarter. We dropped off a bit in the last quarter but came up with a good win 16.5-101 to 7.7-49.
    &nbsp;Good return from Drem with 6 and new boy Rhino with his first goal and then ending up kicking 5 ,Tom (Ed Sheeran )kicking his first goal in 4 years
    and with a great celebration. Backline was solid lead by Huddo and the midfield was great we have got so much improvement still to come.&nbsp;

  <p>Well done team!</p>
